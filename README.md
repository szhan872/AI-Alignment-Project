# AI-Alignment-Project

## Introduction
This repository contains a suite of AI models designed to evaluate and align text data across various dimensions, including toxicity, bias, and fairness. Our goal is to promote the development of more ethical, unbiased, and equitable AI systems by providing tools to assess and mitigate harmful content in text data.

## Features
- **Toxicity Detection:** Identify and quantify toxic content in text to foster healthier online interactions.
- **Bias Assessment:** Evaluate text for biased language to ensure fair and equitable AI treatments.
- **Fairness Metrics:** Implement fairness metrics to audit AI models for discriminatory behaviors.

### Usage
Refer to individual model directories for specific usage instructions. Typically, you can run a model using:
