# Bias Detection Model

This directory contains the bias detection model that is trained for classifying textual data into 1 for "biased" and 0 for "non-biased" binary category.  

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- recommended: pytorch with cuda:

```python
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository

2. Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model
- **Bias Detection Model:** The link to the model is D1V1DE/bias-detection on huggingface. A DistillRoBERTa bias classification model fine-tuned from valurank/distilroberta-bias. MBIC dataset is used as training data.
