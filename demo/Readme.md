# Toxicity Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project is designed to identify and analyze toxic comments using various tools including the Perspective API and the Detoxify library. The purpose is to evaluate texts, filter out toxic content, and provide a more user-friendly communication environment.

## Features
- **Toxicity Detection**: Leveraging machine learning models to detect different levels of toxicity in text.
- **Detoxification**: Implementing methods to reduce the toxicity score of given texts by substituting certain words.
- **API Utilization**: Using the Perspective API to analyze and score the toxicity of comments.
- **Data Visualization**: Generating ROC curves and other visualizations to assess the performance of the models.
