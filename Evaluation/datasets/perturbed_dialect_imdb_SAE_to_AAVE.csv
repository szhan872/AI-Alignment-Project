"I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from mah video store cause of alll da controversy dat surrounded it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard dat at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it eva tried to enter dis country, therefore bein a fan of films considered ""controversial"" I really had to see dis fir myself.<br /><br />Da plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can abt life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to makin sum sort of documentary on wht da average Swede thought bout certain political issues such as da Vietnam War and race issues in da United States. In between askin politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm bout their opinions on politics, she has sex witt her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />Wat kills me abt I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is dat 40 yrs ago, dis was considered pornographic. Really, da sex and nudity scenes r few and far between, even then it's not shot like sum cheaply made porno. While mah countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity r a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to gud old boi John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend da filmmakers fir da fact dat any sex shown in da film is shown fir artistic purposes rather den jus to shock folks and make paper to b shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a gud film fa any1 wantin to study da meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, dis film doesn't have much of a plot.",0
"""I Am Curious: Yellow"" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter wat one's political views r cause dis film can hardly b taken srsly on any level. As fa da claim dat frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, dat isn't tru. I've seen R-rated films w male nudity. Granted, they only offer sum fleeting views, but where r da R-rated films wid gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, b/c they don't exist. Da same goes fa those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in da breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like Da Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to da site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. B4 cryin (or implying) ""double-standard"" in matters of nudity, da mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: thea r no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and da same cannot b said fir a man. In fact, youu generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. Dis alleged double-standard is less a double standard den an admittedly depressing ability to cum to terms culturally wid da insides of women's bodies.",0
"If only to avoid makin dis type of film in da future. Dis film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One mite feel virtuous fa layin thru it bc it touches on soo many IMPORTANT issues but it does soo w/o any discernable motive. Da viewer comes away wid no new perspectives (unless one comes up wid one while one's mind wanders, as it gon invariably do durin dis pointless film).<br /><br />One mite betta spend one's time starin outt a window at a tree growin.<br /><br />",0
"Dis film was def inspired by Godard's Masculin, féminin and I urge youu to see dat film instead.<br /><br />Da film has 2 strong elements and those r, (1) da realistic actin (2) da impressive, undeservedly gud, photo. Apart from dat, wat strikes me most is da endless stream of silliness. Lena Nyman has to b most annoyin actress in da world. She acts soo dumb and w/ alll da nudity in dis film,...it's unattractive. Comparing to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced witt stupidity. W/O goin too far on dis subject, I would say dat follows from da difference in ideals between da French and da Swedish society.<br /><br />A movie of its time, and place. 2/10.",0
"Oh, homeboy...after hearin bou dis ridiculous film fir umpteen yrs alll I can think of is dat old Peggy Lee song..<br /><br />""Is dat alll dere is??"" ...I was jus an early teen when dis smoked fish hit da U.S. I was too young to get in da theater (although I did manage to sneak into ""Goodbye Columbus""). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see dis film, except now I was as old as mah parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />Da ONLY reason dis film was not condemned to da anonymous sands of time was cause of da obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of pple flocked to dis stinker, thinkin they were goin to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shoppin malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes w saggy, pale actors.<br /><br />Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..w.e dis thing was, shred it, burn it, then shiit da ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its borin pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't fa da censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.<br /><br />Instead, da ""I Am Blank, Blank"" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly fa yrs as a titilation fa porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - fa gay films, I Am Curious, Black - fa blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten yrs or soo da thing rises from da dead, to b viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see dat ""naughty sex film"" dat ""revolutionized da film industry""...<br /><br />Yeesh, avoid like da plague..Or if youu MUST see it - rent da video and fast forward to da ""dirty"" parts, jus to get it ova witt.<br /><br />",0
"I would put dis at da top of mah list of films in da category of unwatchable trash! Dere r films dat r badd, but da worst kind r da ones dat r unwatchable but yu r suppose to like em b/c they r suppose to b gud fir youu! Da sex sequences, soo shocking in its day, couldn't even arouse a rabbit. Da soo called controversial politics is strictly high schoo sophomore amateur nite Marxism. Da film is self-consciously arty in da worst sense of da term. Da photography is in a harsh grainy black and white. Sum scenes r outt of focus or taken from da wrong angle. Even da sound is badd! And sum niggas call dis art?<br /><br />",0
"Whoever wrote da screenplay fa dis movie obviously never consulted any books bou Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen soo many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early yrs in Celoron and Jamestown to her later yrs witt Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on fa pages. In alll, I believe dat Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable folks who simply cannot b portrayed by any1 other den theyself. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would b irate at how many mistakes were made in dis film. Da filmmakers tried hard, but da movie seems awfully sloppy to me.",0
"When I first saw a glimpse of dis movie, I quickly noticed da actress who was playin da role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian wid incredible talent. To think abt a legend like Lucille Ball bein portrayed da way she was in da movie is horrendous. I cannot believe outt of alll da actresses in da world who could play a much betta Lucy, da producers decided to get Rachel York. She mite b a gud actress in other roles but to play da role of Lucille Ball is tuff. It is pretty hard to find sum1 who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find somebody a bit similar in looks and talent. If u noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Luvv Lucy like da chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothin is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it alll offf, Danny Pino playin Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his actn is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as badd as da characters of Lucy and Ricky.<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and da story is badly tld. If dudes want to kno da real life shii of Lucille Ball, I suggest watchin A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read da book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If u want to see a docudrama, ""B4 da Laughter"" would b a betta choice. Da casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in ""B4 da Laughter"" is much betta compared to dis. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather den nothin.",0
"Who r dese ""They""- da actors? da filmmakers? Certainly couldn't b da audience- dis is among da most air-puffed productions in existence. It's da kind of movie dat looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot TOO much fun, nobody is geting any actual wrk done, and dat almost always makes fir a movie dat's no fun to watch.<br /><br />Ritter dons glasses soo as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of da bespectacled Bogdanovich; da scenes witt da breezy Ms. Stratten r sweet, but have an embarrassing, look-dudes-I'm-dating-da-prom-queen feel to em. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate da meager plot, which requires em to pursue Audrey Hepburn w/ alll da interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In da meantime, da budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew sexii and pick up sum fairly disturbing pointers on 'luv' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn, drawing on her dignity, manages to rise above da proceedings- but she has da monumental challenge of playin herself, ostensibly.) Erbody looks great, but soo wat? It's a movie and we can expect dat much, if dat's wat yu're lookin fir u'd b betta offf pickin up a copy of Vogue.<br /><br />Oh- and it has to b mentioned dat Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys, even apart from her singin, which, while competent, is wholly unconvincing... da country and western numbers r woefully mismatched wit da standards on da soundtrack. Surely dis is NOT wht Gershwin (who wrote da song from which da movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of da 20's may have been slight, but at least they were long on charm. ""They Alll Laughed"" tries to coast on its gud intentions, but nobody- least of alll Peter Bogdanovich - has da gud sense to put on da brakes.<br /><br />Due in no small part to da tragic death of Dorothy Stratten, dis movie has a special place in da heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it bk from its producers, then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among da more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories, soo dere's no joy in disrespecting da film... dere _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes. But ""Laughed"" is a faint echo of ""Da Last Pic Show"", ""Paper Moon"" or ""Wht's Up, Doc""- following ""Daisy Miller"" and ""At Long Last Luh"", it was a thundering confirmation of da phase from which P.B. has never emerged.<br /><br />Alll in alll, tho, da movie is harmless, only a waste of rental. I want to watch dudes havin a gud time, imma go to da park on a sunny day. Fir filmic expressions of joy and luvv, imma stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy...",0
"Dis is said to b a personal film fa Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life but changed things around to fit da characters, who r detectives. Dese detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getn em. Sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker den a detective, doesn't it? Dis entire movie was written by Peter, and it shows how outt of touch w real folks he was. U're suppose to write wht youu kno, and he did dat, indeed. And leaves da audience bored and confused, and jealous, fa dat matter. Dis is a curio fir folks who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered ryte after filming. But Patti Hanson, who would, in real life, marry Keith Richards, was also a model, like Stratten, but is a lot betta and has a more ample part. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She doesn't have a lot to do w da story, which is pretty convoluted to begin w. Alll in alll, every character in dis film is sumbody dat very few folks can relate witt, unless u're millionaire from Manhattan wid beautiful supermodels at yo beckon call. Fir da rest of us, it's an irritatin snore fest. Dat's wht happens when youu're outt of touch. Yu entertain yo few frens witt inside jokes, and bore alll da rest.",0
"It was great to see sum of mah fav stars of 30 yrs ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked quite wonderful. But dat was it. They were not given any characters or gud lines to wrk w. I neither understood or cared wht da characters were doin.<br /><br />Sum of da smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts. They showed sum talent and it is sad they didn't go on to star in more and betta films. Sadly, I didn't think Dorothy Stratten got a chance to act in dis her only important film role.<br /><br />Da film appears to have sum fans, and I was very open-minded when I started watchin it. I am a bigg Peter Bogdanovich fan and I enjoyed his last movie, ""Cat's Meow"" and alll his early ones from ""Targets"" to ""Nickleodeon"". Soo, it really surprised me dat I was barely able to keep awake watchin dis one.<br /><br />It is ironic dat dis movie is bout a detective agency where da detectives and clients get romantically involved wid each other. Five yrs later, Bogdanovich's ex-gf, Cybil Shepherd had a hit television series called ""Moonlighting"" stealin da story idea from Bogdanovich. Of course, dere was a great difference in dat da series relied on tons of witty dialogue, while dis tries to make do wit slapstick and a few screwball lines.<br /><br />Bottom line: It ain't no ""Paper Moon"" and only a very pale version of ""Wht's Up, Doc"".",0
"I can't believe dat those thnk dis movie herein aren't thinkin of sum other film. I was prepared fir da possibility dat dis would b awful, but da script (or lack thereof) makes fa a film dat's also pointless. On da plus side, da general level of craft on da part of da actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when youu've got a sow's ear to wrk wid yu can't make a silk purse. Ben G fans should stick witt jus abt any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Pic Show and Finishline. Fans of cheap laughs at da expense of those who seem to b askin fa it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killin of da Unicorn.",0
"Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in ur films! Bob Fosse's ""Star 80"" abt Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SIS after her murder at da hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting den Dorothy herself on da silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either..I expected to see sum sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful ""poodlesque"" hair-do....Very disappointing....""Paper Moon"" and ""Da Last Pic Show"" I could watch again and again. Dis clunker I could barely sit thru once. Dis movie was reputedly not released cuz of da brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think da real reason was cause it was soo badd!",0
"Its not da cast. A finer group of actors, u could not find. Its not da settin. Da director is in luvv w/ New York City, and by da end of da film, soo r we alll! Woody Allen could not improve upon wat Bogdonovich has done hea. If u r goin to fall in luv, or find luv, Manhattan is da place to go. No, da problem wit da movie is da script. Dere is none. Da actors fall in luhhh at first sight, words r unnecessary. In da director's own experience in Hollywood dat is wht happens when they go to wrk on da set. It is reality to em, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in da real world. Soo, in da end, da movie is hollow, and shallow, and txt-less.",0
"Todayy I found ""They Alll Laughed"" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information bout dis movie, but I liked da references listed on its cover: da names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, da price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and da User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in ""Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003"" and  dang  4 stars! Soo, I decided dat I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have jus finished watchin ""They Alll Laughed"" and I found it a very borin overrated movie. Da characters r badly developed, and I spent lots of mins to kno their roles in da story. Da plot is spose to b funnie (private eyes who fall in luhhh fir da women they r chasin), but I have not laughed along da whole story. Da coincidences, in a bigass city like New York, r ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, w da women fallin fir em as if her were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In da end, da greater attractions certainly r da presence of da Playboy centerfold and playmate of da year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after da release of dis movie, and whose life was showed in ""Star 80"" and ""Death of a Centerfold: Da Dorothy Stratten Story""; da amazin beauty of da sexii Patti Hansen, da future Mrs. Keith Richards; da always wonderful, even bein fifty-2 yrs old, Audrey Hepburn; and da song ""Amigo"", from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like em, Roberto Carlos has been da most popular Brazilian singer since da end of da 60's and is called by his fans as ""Da King"". I gon keep dis movie in mah collection only bc of dese attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). Mah vote is 4.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Muito Riso e Muita Alegria"" (""Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness"")",0
"Dis film is jus plain horrible. John Ritter doin pratt falls, 75% of da actors delivering their lines as if they were reading em from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixin (dialogue is tuff to pick up in places ova da background noise), and a plot dat really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd eva say dis, but Dorothy Stratten is not da worst actress in dis film. Thea r at least 3 others dat suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines wid da passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids r awful (da oldest one is def reading her lines from a cue card). Dis movie is srsly horrible. Thea's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get anotha project til 4 yrs later. Plz don't watch it. If youu see it in yo television listings, cancel yo cable. If a homie suggests it to u, reconsider ur friendship. If ur spouse wants to watch it, yu're betta offf finding anotha soulmate. I'd rather gouge mah eyes outt wit lawn darts den sit thru dis piece of garbage again. If I could sum dis film up in one word, dat word would b: Suckotrocity",0
"Mah interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase dis video. Although it had great actors/actresses, thea were jus too many subplots goin on to retain interest. Plus it jus wasn't dat interesting. Dialogue was stiff and confusing and da story jus flipped around too much to b believable. I was pretty disappointed in wat I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last movies. imma always luvv John Ritter best in slapstick. He was jus too lame heaa.",0
"I have dis film outt of da library rite now and I haven't finished watchin it. It is soo badd I am in disbelief. Audrey Hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished wit it in 'Robin and Marian.' Dis is da worst thing bout dis appallingly dumb film. It's really only of interest b/c it was her last feature film and b/c of da Dorothy Stratten appearance jus prior to her homicide.<br /><br />Dere is nothin but idiocy between Gazzara and his cronies. Lil signals and lil bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which dis is da faintest, palest shadow.<br /><br />Who could believe dat thea r even sum of da same Manhattan environs dat Hepburn inhabited soo magically and even mythically in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' twenty yrs earlier? Da soundtrack of old Sinatra songs and da Gershwin song from which da title is taken is too loud and obvious--yu sure don't have to wait fa da credits to find outt dat sumin was subtly woven into da cine-musique of da pic to kno when da songs blasted outt at u.<br /><br />'Reverting to type' means goin bacc up as well as goin bak downn, I guess. In dis case, Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady is alll youu see of sum1 who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. Heaa she has even lost her talent as a star. If somebody whose talent was continuing to grow in da period, like Ann-Margret, had played da role, dere would have been sum life in it, even given da unbelievably badd material and Mongoloid-level situations.<br /><br />Hepburn was a great person, of course, greater den most movie stars eva dreamed of bein, and she was once one of da most charming and beautiful of film actors. After dis dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious T.V movie w/ Robert Wagner called 'Luv Among Thieves.' In 'They alll Laughed' it is as tho she were still playin an ingenue in her 50's. Even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doin dis like Lana Turner were infinitely more effective den is Hepburn. Turner took actin srsly even when she was badd. Hepburn doesn't take it srsly at alll, couldn't b bothered w it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really gud wrk was in '2 fa da Road,' perhaps her most bumpin, if possibly not her best in many ways.<br /><br />And dat gurl who plays da country singer is jus sickening. John Ritter is horrible, thea is simply nothin to recommend dis film except to see Dorothy Stratten, who was truly pretty. Otherwise, critic David Thomson's oft-used phrase 'losin his/her talent' never has made more sense.<br /><br />Ben Gazarra had lost alll sex appeal by then, and soo we have 2 films w Gazarra and Hepburn--who could ask fa anything less? Sandra Dee's last, pitiful film 'Lost,' from 2 yrs later, a low-budget nothin, had more to it den dis. At least Ms. Dee spoke in her own voice; by 1981, Audrey Hepburn's accent jus sounded silly; she'd go on to do da PBS 'Gardens of da World w Audrey Hepburn' and dere her somewhat annoyin accent works as she walks thru English gardens witt aristocrats or waxes effusively bout 'wat I like most is when flowers go bacc to nature!' as in naturalized daffodils, but in an actual fictional movie, she jus sounds ridiculous.<br /><br />To think dat 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' was such a profound sort of light poetic thing witt Audrey Hepburn one of da most beautiful women in da world--she was surely one of da most beautiful screen presences in 'Mah Fair Lady', matchin Garbo in several things and Delphine Seyrig in 'Last Year at Marienbad.' And then dis! And her final brief role as da angel 'Hap' in da Spielberg film 'Always' was jus more of da lady shii--corny, witless and stifling.<br /><br />I went to her memorial service at da Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, a beautiful service which included a boyz' choir singin da Shaker hymn 'Simple Gifts.' Da only thing not listed in da program was da sudden playin of Hepburn's singin 'Moon River' on da fire escape in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' and dis brought much emotion and sum real tears outt in da congregation.<br /><br />A great lady who was once a fine actress (as in 'Da Nun's Story') and one of da realest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of da 50's and 60's who became a truly badd one--dat's not alll dat common. And perhaps it is only a great human bein who, in makin such things as film performances trivial, nevertheless has da largeness of mind to want to have da flaws pointed outt mercilessly--which alll of her late film wrk contained in abundance. Most of da tlk bout Hepburn's miscasting is abt 'Mah Fair Lady.' But da one dat should have had da original actress in it was 'Wait Untill Dark,' which had starred Lee Remick on Broadway. Never as celebrated as Hepburn, she was a betta actress in many ways (Hepburn was completely incapable of playin anything really sordid), although Hepburn was at least adequate enough in dat part. After dat, alll of her actn went downhill.",0
"I think I gon make a movie nxt weekend. Oh wait, I'm workin..oh I'm sure I can fit it in. It looks like whoever made dis film fit it in. I hope da makers of dis shit have day jobs becuz dis film sucked!!! It looks like someones home movie and I don't think more den $100 was spent wit it!!! Total shit!!!

Filmed on a budget of wht looks to b bout 20 dollas, TZC is a completely horrible horror movie dat relies on lame, forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore dat's more nasty den frightening. How does a movie like dis even get made? Simply put, avoid TZC like a sexually-transmitted disease.<br /><br />Mah last 2 cents: Humorously enough, dis movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They're brains must have really been damaged to cum up w a craptacular movie like dis.<br /><br />Mah rating: 1 outt of 10(If it were up to me, dis movie would get da rating of negative bajillion)",0
"If da crew behind ""Zombie Chronicles"" eva read dis, heaa's sum advice dudes: <br /><br />1. In a ""Twist Ending""-type movie, it's not a gud idea to insert close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN DA MOVIE in da opening credits. Dat tends to spoil da twists, y'knoe...? <br /><br />2. I kno u produced dis on a shoestring and - to b fair - u worked miracles wid ur budget but plz, hire pple who can actually act. Or at least, walk, tlk and gesture at da same time.

"1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 outt of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie bou flesh-eatin zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yea, we get to see zombies eatting human flesh parts in 3D!! Dang, not!! Dat has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but wat usually makes a zombie movie betta is da underlying story not da actual flesh-eatting. Dat's wat made da original zombie classics gud. Da flesh-eatting was jus thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of dis 3-part chronicle b/c of da lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. Da last story is actually da story da movie started wid(havin a reporter investigating a soo-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eatting zombie's in dat one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch da classics, not dis 3D bore-feast.",0
"Dere's tons of gud-lookin women in dis flick. But alas, dis movie is nudity-free. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one.<br /><br />Ahem. One story in dis film takes place in 1971. Then y da hell r da main characters drivin a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anybody?<br /><br />As yu mite knoe, dis movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it is da most hideous effect I have eva seen. I'm not sure if some1 botched da job on dis, but thea WAS no 3D, jus double-vision blurs. I didn't have da same problem w dis company's other 3D movies, HUNTIN SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, da 3D in those ones sucked too, but wit em I could see a semblance of 3D effect.<br /><br />Dis thing is a bigg ball of nothin.<br /><br />And whoever dat women was who played da daughter of da ear-eatin dame, yum! I'd like to see more of her. In movies, as well. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br /><br />",0
"En route to a small town dat lays way offf da beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. Da strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to da area: in da first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill da woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate theyself when they r attacked by a zombie; and in da second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at havin his grave peed on.<br /><br />Da Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Witten Clancy and director Brad Sykes at makin a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but witt only 2 stories, it falls woefully short. And dat's not da only way in which dis low budget gore flick fails to deliver: da actin is lousy (w/ Joe Haggerty, as da tale-tellin Ebenezer Jackson, givin one of da strangest performances I have eva seen); da locations r uninspired; da script is dreary; thea's a sex scene w/ zero nudity; and da ending.... well, dat beggars belief.<br /><br />To b fair, sum of Sykes' creative camera-wrk is effective (although da gimmicky technique employed as characters run thru da woods is a tad overused) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten offf, eyeballs r plucked outt, a face is removed, brains r squished, and thea is a messy decapitation. Dem positives jus bou make da film bearable, but b warned, Da Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in da park, even fa seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give Da Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise mah rating to 3 since I didn't get to view da film wid da benefit of 3D (although I have a sneakin suspicion dat an extra dimension wouldn't have made dat much of a difference).",0
"W/O wishin to b a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible fir at least 2 of da most dull and clichéd films i've eva seen - dis bein one of em, and Camp Blood bein anotha. <br /><br />Da actn is terrible, da print is shoddy, and everything bout dis film screams ""srsly, youu could do betta yaself"". Maybe dis is a challenge to yall to saturate youtube wit our own zombie related shit?<br /><br />I bought dis fir £1, but rememba, yu can't put a price on 71 mins of ur life.

Dese included:<br /><br />1) Drinkin bleach 2) Rubbin sand in mah eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Witten Clancy 4) Re-enacting da American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex w an old lady.<br /><br />Bj Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote dis? Da dude couldn't even dig a hole properly. Da best ting he did was kick a door downn (da best part of da film). Dis was da worst film I have eva seen, and I've seen White Noise: Da Light. Never has a film had soo many mistakes in it. Mah gf left it heaa, soo now I live wit da shame of owning dis piece of shit.<br /><br />News jus in: Owen Wilson watched dis film and tried to kill hisself. Fact.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH",0
"Amateur, no budget films can b surprisingly gud ... dis however is not one of em.<br /><br />Ah, anotha Brad Sykes atrocity. Da actn is hideous, except fir Emmy Smith who shows sum promise. Da camera ""direction"" needs serious reworking. And no more ""hold da camera and run"" gimmicks either; it jus doesn't wrk. Da special effects r unimaginative, thea's a problem when da effect can b identified in real time. If u're goin to rip offf an ear, plz don't let us see da actor's real ear beneath da blood. Da scenery is bland and borin (same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and da music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really badd guitar driven metal (see da scenery comment).<br /><br />Did I mention da lack of any real plot, or character development? Apparently, da scriptwriter didn't.<br /><br />Whoever is funding dis dude ... plz stop. I've seen sum of his other ""home movies"" (which I gon not plug) and they r jus as badd. Normally, a ""director"" gon grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not dis dude. It's one thing to b an amateur filmmaker, but anybody can b a hack.<br /><br />Def not even a popcorn film ... of course, chewin on popcorn kernels would b less painful den dis effort.<br /><br />Award: Da worst eva military push-ups in a film.",0
AIGHT its not da best film I've eva seen but at da same time I've been able to sit and watch it TWICE!!! story line was pretty awful and durin da first part of da first short story i wondered wat da hell i was watchin but at da same time it was soo awful i loved it cheap laughs alll da way.<br /><br />And Jebidia deserves an Oscar fa his role in dis movie da only thing dat let em downn was half way thru he stopped his silly name callin.<br /><br />overall da film was pretty perfetic but if ur after cheap laughs and u see it in pound land go by it.,0
"Sum films dat youu pick up fa a pound turn outt to b rather gud - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie dat were great, but although Hardgore released sum Fulci films amongst others, da bulk of their output is shit like Da Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />Da only positive thing I can say bout dis film is dat it's nowhere near as annoyin as da Stink of Flesh. Other den dat, its a very clumsy anthology film w da technical competence of a Lego housee built by a whelk.<br /><br />It's been noted elsewhere, but yu really do have to worry abt a film dat inserts previews of da action into its credit sequence, soo by da time it gets to da zombie attacks, u've seen it alll already.<br /><br />Badd movie fans gon have a ball watchin da 18,000 continuity mistakes and da diabolical actn of da cast (especially da hitchhiker, who was soo badd he did make me laugh a bit), and s/0 to Hardgore fir getn in to da spirit of things by releasing a print soo badd it felt like I was watchin sum beat up home video of a camping trip.<br /><br />Awful, awful shyt. We've alll made shii like dis when we've gotten a hold of a camera, but common sense prevails and dese films languish in our cupboards somewhere. Avoid.",0

Da story had da most awful plot, and well da army dude had put wat he thought was army like and then jus went ova da top, i only watched it to laugh at how badd it was, and hoped it was leading onto da real movie. I cnt believe it was under da 2 nite rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a plz take dis fir free and get it outt of our sight. I think thea was one semi decent actor other den da woman, i think da only thing IGHT witt da budget was da make up, but they show every important scene of da film in da beginning music bit.

"..Oh wait, I can! Dis movie is not fa da typical film snob, unless yu want to brush up on yo typical cinematic definitions, like ""continuity editing"" and ""geographic match"".

I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since da actn was jus horrible. I think it only got attention bc it has a 3d which I did not watch. If u're a b-movie buff, and by b-movie I mean BADD movie, then dis film is fa youu. It's home-movie and alll non-sense style gon keep yu laughin fa as long as yu can stay awake.

"Youu have to admire Brad Sykes even if yu don't particularly want to, a man who churns outt budget horror after budget horror to less den enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doin it alll da same. Even da half-hearted praise den surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of dis as anybody. Brad normally manages to throw sumtin interesting into da mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, w.e, but w/o da funds to take it further den base level, he relies on da audience to cut em sum slack and appreciate it fir wht it is and wat it could b. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funnie performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes dat he can sense dat dis oddball turn is goin to wrk within da framework of da film.

Worse still, da 2 stories which make up da bulk of da runnin time r utterly routine, made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible fir da likes of CAMP BLOOD (1999). Dis isn't a 'fun' movie in da sense dat Ed Wood's movies r 'fun' (he, at least, believed in wht he was doin and was sincere in his efforts, despite a lack of talent); Sykes' home-made movies r, in fact, irritatin, borin and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue, and most viewers gon feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative, badly-conceived junk.

"A woman asks fa advice on da road to reach a mysterious town, and hears 2 ghoulish stories from da local weirdo, both zombie related. But perhaps fate has sumin nasty in store fa her too...<br /><br />Da Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of da worst films I have eva seen. In fact I must confess, soo badd was it I fast forwarded thru most of da garbage. And dere was a lot of dat, believe me. It runs fa jus 69 mins, and thea is still tons of filler. U get sum skinhead doin a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (dat rhymed, tee hee) and sum fine examples of y sum bitches should never become actors.<br /><br />As fa da title characters, they barely even have a footnote in da film. Y, u get more undead action in da intro den u do da preceding feature! Doe, considering how lame da eyes bursting outt of sockets and da eatting of brains sequences r (amongst other 'delights'), maybe dat's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />And to top it alll offf, it looks likes it's been filmed on sum1's mobile phn fir broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-wrk, scratches on da print, flickering lights... I had to rub mah eyes when I realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even da clothes and fashioned look bout three decades outt of date!<br /><br />If yu think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles havin not seen da whole film, then go ahead. YU try sittin thru it, I betcha yu won't even make it to da first appearance of da blue-smartie coloured freaks b4 wit yo excuses and leavin.

I don't kno how they could have possibly said dat to b in da 70s. He mite have had a cell fone too, I cnt rememba, It was jus horrible.

":Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Luhhh's Abiding Joy. I had been waitin a really long time to see it and I finally got da chance when it re-aired Thursday nite on Hallmark. I luv da first three ""Luh"" movies but dis one was nothin like I thought it was goin to b. Da whole movie was sad and depressing, thea were way to many goofs, and da editing was very poor - to many scenes outt of context. I also think da death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in da movie jus didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of da actors really wanted to b dere - they were alll lacking emotion. Dere seemed to b no interaction between Missie and Willie at alll.<br /><br />I think da script writers should have went more by da book. It seems like every movie dat's been made soo far jus slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in da movie they never mentioned a thing bout da mines and da 2 boyz or Clark getn hurt cause of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather den jus heard.<br /><br />Outt of da 4 movies dat have been made soo far I'd have to say dat Luhh's Abiding Joy is mah least fav. I hope w da nxt 4 movies dat more of da book is followed and if Clarks character is in em I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't soo bland. I also hope thea is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows wat da script writers gon have in store nxt.",0
"I've seen alll 4 of da movies in dis series. Each one strays further and further from da books. Dis is da worst one yet. Mah problem is dat it does not follow da book it is titled after in any way! Da directors and producers should have named it any thing other den ""Luvv's Abiding Joy."" Da only thing abt dis movie dat remotely resembles da book r da names of sum of da characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Da names/ages/genders of da children r wrong. Da entire story line is no where in da book.<br /><br />I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title dat is not correct in any way. Da music is too loud. Da actors r not convincing - they lack emotions.<br /><br />If u want a gud fam movie, dis mite do. It is clean. Don't watch it, doe, if yu r hopin fa a condensed version of da book. I hope dat dis gon b da last movie from dis series, but I doubt it. If thea r more movies made, I wish Micheal Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to da original plot and story lines. Da books r excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies!",0
"I very much looked forward to dis movie. Its a gud fam movie; however, if Micheal Landon Jr.'s editing team did a betta job of editing, da movie would b much betta. Too many scenes outt of context. I do hope thea is anotha movie from da series, they're alll very gud. But, if anotha one is made, I beg em to take betta care at editing. Dis story was alll ova da place and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate becuz da other movies of da series were great. I enjoy da story of Willie and Missy; they're both great role models. Plus, da romantic side of da viewers always enjoy a gud luh story.",0
"I have read alll of da Luv Cum Softly books. Knowing full well dat movies can not use alll aspects of da book,but generally they at least have da main point of da book. I was highly disappointed in dis movie. Da only thing dat they have in dis movie dat is in da book is dat Missy's father comes to visit,(although in da book both parents cum). Dat is alll. Da story line was soo twisted and far fetch and yea, sad, from da book, dat I jus couldn't enjoy it. Even if I didn't read da book it was too sad. I do kno dat Pioneer life was rough,but da whole movie was a downer. Da rating is fir havin da same fam orientation of da film dat makes em great.",0
"As a Southern Baptist, it pains me dat I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. Dere certainly aren't soo many dat I want to discourage film-makers from a genre dat's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say dat ""Luv's Abiding Joy"" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. Da plot is predictable, da actn mediocre (I'm bein kind), and da editing atrocious. As a T.V movie it mite have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to b desired. Keep trynna dudes. Yu've got to have a movie abt abt real Christians inside youu somewhere. Mite I suggest yu turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis fa sum inspiration?",0
"WARNING: Dis review contains SPOILERS. Do not read if youu don't want sum points revealed to yu b4 u watch da film.<br /><br />Wit a cast like dis, yu wonder whether or not da actors and actresses knew exactly wht they were gettin into. Did they see da script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of da Third Kind was such a hit dat dis one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on da director's credentials? I mean, would YOUU do a movie w/ da director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct da infamous `Final Justice,' made dis. It makes u wonder how da ppl of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss outt on `Da Return.'<br /><br />Da film is set in a small town in New Mexico. alil boi and gurl r in da street unsupervised one nite when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers ova em. In prolly da worst special effect sequence of da film, da ship spews sum kind of red ink on em. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of da camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, soo rite away youu r treated w/ cheese. Anyhow, da ship leaves and da adults don't believe da children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to b a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' fir proof, as they r outstanding), who is playin a prospector, or as I called em, da Miner 1949er. He steps outt of da cave he is in, and he and his dog r inked by da ship. Twenty-five yrs go by, and da gurl has grown up to b Cybill Shepherd, who works witt her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or sumtin like dat. Shepherd spots sum strange phenomena in satellite pics ova dat lil New Mexico town, and she travels thea to research it. Once she gets dere, da local ranchers harass her, and blame her fa da recent slew of cattle mutilations dat have been goin on, and deputy Jan-Micheal Vincent comes to her rescue. From dis point on, da film really drags as da 2 quickly fall fa each other, especially after Vincent wards offf da locals and informs Shepherd dat he was da lil boi dat saw da ship witt her twenty-five yrs earlier. While dis borin mess is happenin, Vincent Schiavelli, wid his killer dog at his side, is walkin around killin da cattle and any mfs he runs into wit an unusual item. Yu knoe those glowing plastic sticks stores sell fa trick-or-treaters at Halloween, da kind dat yu shake to make em glow? Schiavelli uses wht looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in bitches. It's da second-worst effect in da movie. Every time Schiavelli is on screen wit da glow stick, da scene's atmosphere suddenly turns dark, like da filmmakers thought da glow stick needed dat enhancement. It ends up wit da movie look even cheaper den it is.<br /><br />And wat does alll dis lead up to? It's hard to tell when da final, confusing scene arrives. See, Burr and his team of scientists try to explain da satellite images dat Shepherd found as sum kind of `callin card,' but none of it makes sense. Y do Shepherd and Vincent age and Schiavelli does not? Schiavelli explains y he is killin cattle and niggas and y he wants Shepherd dead, but even dat doesn't make much sense when u really think abt it. I mean, y doesn't he kill Jan-Micheal Vincent? After alll, he had twenty-five yrs to do it. And da aliens won't need em if Shepherd is dead anyhow, soo y try to kill her? Speakin of da aliens, it is never clear wht they really wanted outt of Shepherd and Vincent. Wat is their goal? Y do they wait soo long to intervene? How could they b soo sure Shepherd would cum bck? Not dat da answer to any of dem and other questions would have made `Da Return' any more pleasant. Yu would still have badd lines, really badd actin, particularly by Shepherd, cheesy effects, and poor direction. Luckily, da stars escaped from dis movie. Cybill Shepherd soon went on to star in `Moonlighting' w Bruce Willis. Jan-Micheal Vincent went on to b featured in dozens of B-movies, often in ova-da-top parts. Raymond Burr made a pile of Perry Mason television movies ryte up til his death. Vincent Schiavelli went on to b a great character actor in a bigass number of films. Martin Landau, who played a kooky law enforcement officer, quickly made da terrific `Alone in da Dark' and da awful `Da Bein' b4 rollin into da films he has been famous fa recently. Youu can bet none of dese stars eva want their careers to return to `Da Return.' Zantara's score: 2 outt of 10.",0
"As a nigga I did think da weapon da murderer wielded was coo, however I was a nigga and soo I was a bit dum. Even as a dum nigga tho da movies plot was dumb and a bit borin when da killer was not usin his light knife to kill niggas. Wat amazes me is dat da movie has a really solid cast in it. Wat script did they read when agreeing to b in dis movie as it is most assuredly borin and only a means to show offf a light saber on a very small scale. Da plot at times is incomprehensible and da end is totally chaotic. Da whole film seems to rotate around aliens and da one weapon. Da plot has 2 kids and sum niggah havin an alien encounter, flash yrs later and dere seems to b a return as it were in da mix. Dead animals and such to b explored and fir sum reason da one nigga gets da weapon of da aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killin spree. Srsly, u jus have to wonder y dis movie was made, if yu r goin to have a killer have sum gud death scenes, if youu r goin to have alien encounters show more den a weird light vortex thing, and if youu r goin to have light sabers then call yaself star wars.",0

"Dis movie sucked. It really was a waste of mah life. Da actin was atrocious, da plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, dem mfs get ""terrorized"" by dis lame ""crazed killer"", but completely fail to fight bak in any manner. And dis is after they take a raft on a camping trip, w/ no gear, and show up at a campsite dat is already assembled and completely stocked wit food and clothes and da daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missin, they panic dat they're stuck in da woods, but then da daughters bf jus shows up and they apparently never consider dat they could jus hike outt of da woods like he did to get to em.

And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue... Jus seemed soo ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was awful I thought. She was very annoyin.

Da original book of dis was set in da 1950s but dat won't do fa da T.V series bc most mfs watch fa da 1930s style. Ironically da tube train near da end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train soo da Underground can play at dat game too. Hangin da storyline on a plot bou da Jarrow March was feeble but da 50s version had students who were beginning to think bout da world around em soo I suppose wit em think bout da poverty of da marchers is much da same thing. Alll da shyt bou Japp havin to cater fir hisself was weak too but they had to put somthing in to fill da time. Dis would have made a decent half hr show or they could have filmed da book and made it a betta long show. It is obvious dis episode is a victim of style ova content.,0

As I have jus watched alll of da episodes up to dis point ova da past week...I'd have to say dat dis was by far da worst, and I jus wanted to warn others not to start wit dis one.",0
"Zentropa has much in common wit Da Third Man, anotha noir-like film set among da rubble of postwar Europe. Like TTM, thea is much inventive camera wrk. Dere is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved wid a woman he doesn't really kno, and whose naivety is alll da more striking in contrast w/ da natives.<br /><br />But I'd have to say dat Da Third Man has a more well-crafted storyline. Zentropa is a bit disjointed in dis respect. Perhaps dis is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare, and makin it too coherent would spoil da effect. <br /><br />Dis movie is unrelentingly grim--""noir"" in more den one sense; one never sees da sun shine. Grim, but intriguing, and frightening.",1
"Zentropa is da most original movie I've seen in yrs. If youu like unique thrillers dat r influenced by film noir, then dis is jus da rite cure fa alll of those Hollywood summer blockbusters clogging da theaters dese dayz. Von Trier's follow-ups like Breakin da Waves have gotten more acclaim, but dis is really his best wrk. It is flashy w/o bein distracting and offers da bumpin combination of suspense and dark humor. It's too badd he decided handheld cameras were da wave of da future. It's hard to say who talked em away from da style he exhibits heaa, but it's everybody's loss dat he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead.",1
"Lars Von Trier is never backward in tryin outt new techniques. Sum of em r very original while others r best forgotten.<br /><br />He depicts postwar Germany as a nightmarish train journey.

Thea r many allusions to da German fanaticism of adherence to such dumb details.<br /><br />Da railway journey is like an allegory reppin man's procession thru life w/ alll its trials and tribulations. In one sequence Leo dashes thru da bacc carriages to discover em filled wid half-starved bodies appearing to have jus escaped from Auschwitz . Dese images, horrible as they r, r fleeting as in a dream, each wid its own terrible impact yet unconnected.<br /><br />At a station called Urmitz Leo jumps from da train w a parceled bomb. In view of many by-standers he connects da bomb to da underside of a carriage. He returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock. Later he jumps from da train (at high speed) and lies in da coo grass on a river bank. Lookin at da stars above he decides dat his job is to build and not destroy. Subsequently as he sees da train approaching a bigass bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board da train and stop da clock. If yu care to analyse da shii it is a completely impossible task. Quite ridiculous in fact. It could only happen in a dream.<br /><br />It's strange how one remembers lil details such as a row of cups hangin on hooks and rattling away witt da swaying of da train.<br /><br />Despite da fact dat dis film is widely acclaimed, I prefer Lars Von Trier's later films (Breakin da Waves and Da Idiots). Da bomb scene described above really put me offf. Perhaps I'm a realist.",1
"*Contains spoilers due to me havin to describe sum film techniques, soo read at yo own risk!*<br /><br />I loved dis film. Da use of tinting in sum of da scenes makes it seem like an old photograph cum to life. I also enjoyed da projection of folks on a bacc screen. Fir instance, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind em rather den in a typical split screen. Her face is bigass in da bck and Leo's is in da foreground.<br /><br />One of da best uses of dis is when da young boyz kill da Ravensteins on da train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, witt facial close ups. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, dat intense constant style coupled wit da spray of red to convey tons of horror w/o much gore. Same wit da scene when Katharina finds her father dead in da bathtub...yu can only see da red water on da side. It is one of da things I luv abt Von Trier, his understatement of horror, which ends up wit it alll da more creepy.<br /><br />Da use of txt in da film was unique, like when Leo's character is pushed by da word, ""Werewolf."" I have never seen anything like dat in a film.<br /><br />Da use of black comedy in dis film was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo's uncle. It brings up da snickers I got from his role in da Kingdom (Riget.) Dis humor makes da plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against da terrible backdrop of WW2 and alll da chaos, easier to take. It reminds me of Riget in da way da hospital administrator is tryin to maintain a normalcy at da end of part one when everything is goin crazyy. It shows dat sum dudes r truly oblivious to da awful things happenin around em. Yet sum mfs, like Leo, r tuned in, but do nothin positive bou it.<br /><br />Da voice ova, done expertly well by Max von Sydow, is amusing too. It draws yu into da story and makes yu jump into Leo's head, which at times is a scary place to b.<br /><br />Da movie brings up da point dat one is a coward if they don't claim a side. I see da same idea used in Dancer in da Dark, where Bjork's character doesn't speak up fa herself and ends up bein her own destruction. Actually, at one time, Von Trier seemed anti-woman to me, by wit Breakin da Waves and Dancer, but now I knoe his male characters don't fare well either! I found myself at da same place durin da end of Dancer, when u wht want da main character to rethink their actions, but of course, they never do!",1
"Dat was da first thing dat sprang to mind as I watched da closing credits to Europa make dere was across da screen, never in mah entire life have I seen a film of such technical boss, da visuals of Europa r soo impressive dat any film I watch in it's wake gon only pale in comparison, forget ur Micheal Bay, Ridley Scott slick Hollywood cinematography, Europa has more ethereal beauty den anything those 2 could conjure up in a million yrs. Now I'd b da first to hail Lars von Trier a boss jus offf da bacc of his films Breakin da Waves and Dancer in da Dark, but dis is dumb, da fact dat Europa has gone un-noticed by film experts fir soo long is a crime against cinema, whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at da academy awards (but wht do da kno) Europa has been hidden away, absent form video stores and (til recently) any British T.V channels. <br /><br />Da visuals in Europa r not MTV gloss; it's not a case of style ova substance, its more a case of substance dictating style. Much like his first film Da Element of Crime, von Trier uses da perspective of da main character to draw us into his world, and much like Element, da film begins wid da main character (or in da case of Europa, we da audience) bein hypnotized. As we move dwn da tracks, da voice of da Narrator (Max von Sydow) counts us downn into a deep slp, untill we awake in Europa. Dis allows von Trier and his three cinematographers to pay wid da conventions of time and imagery, dere r many scenes in Europa when a character in da background, who is in black and white, gon interact wit a person in da foreground who gon b colour, von Trier is tryin to show us how much precedence da coloured item or person has ova da plot, fir instance, it's no surprise dat da first shot of Leopold Kessler (Jean-marc Barr) is in colour, since he is da only character who's actions have superiority ova da film. <br /><br />Da performances r gud, they may not b on par wid performances in later von Trier films, but dat's jus b/c da images r sometimes soo distracting dat u don't really pick up on em da first time round. But I would like to point outt da fantastic performance of Jean-Marc Barr in da lead role, whose blind idealism is slowly warn downn by da 2 opposing sides, untill he erupts in da films final act. Again, muck like Da Element of Crime, da film ends wid our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state, left in dis terrible place, w/ only da continuing narration of von Sydow to seal his fate. Europa is a tremendous film, and I cnt help thinkin wat a shame dat von Trier has abandoned dis way of filming, since he was clearly one of da most talented visual directors workin at dat time, Europa, much like da rest of his cinematic cannon is filled witt a wealth of iconic scenes. His dedication to composition and mise-en-scene is unrivalled, not to mention his use of sound and production design. But since his no-frills melodramas turned outt to b Breakin da Waves and Dancer in da Dark then who can argue, but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent. 10/10",1
"I had started to lose mah faith in films of recent bein inundated wit da typical Genre Hollywood film. Story lines fail, and camera wrk is merely copied from da last film of similiar taste. But, then I saw Zentropa (Europa) and mah faith was renewed. Not only is da metaphorical storyline enthralling but da use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. Da narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes u thru a spellbounding journey every step of da way and engrosses yu into Europa 1945. We have alll seen death put on screen in a hunnit thousand ways but da beauty of dis film is how it takes youu thru every slow-movin moment dat leads u to death. Unlike many films it doesn't cut after one second of showin (fa example) a knife but forces u to watch da devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man's final moments. I think we can alll take sumin diff away from wat dis movie is tryn to say but it is deff worth takin da time to find outt wat it alll really means. I would luhhh to tlk more in depth bout da film fir any one who wishes to send me an email. Enjoy it!",1
"Critics need to review wat they class as a quality movie. I think da critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to da Matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air, a film witt soo many layers dat one viewing is not enough to kno or appreciate dis outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows dat old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. Da bck projection effect he uses durin da film arouses and enhances da characters, and da focus of da convo they r havin. Other effects he uses such as da colour and black and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and da gurl wid da red coat grabs attention and enhances da drama and meaning of da scene. Da commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, again maintaining da focus on da central characters in da scene and thea actions.<br /><br />I could tlk abt da effects more but I think u alll would agree they push dis film into a category of its own, and really heighten da drama of da film. A film to buy if u don't own already and one to see if u have not.<br /><br />10/10 Don't miss dis artistic noir film from one of da great film directors.",1
"It is not every film's job to stimulate yu superficially. I gon take an ambitious failure ova a mass-market hit any day. While dis really can't b described as a failure, da sum of its parts remains ambiguous. Dat indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watchin it again and again. Dis is a challenging, provocative movie dat does not wrap things up neatly. Da problem w da movie is in its structure. Its inpenetrable plot seems to b winding up, jus as a second ending is tacked on. Doe everything is technically dazzling, da movie is exactly too long by dat unit. Da long-delayed climax of Leo's awakening comes bout 20 mins late.<br /><br />Great cinematography often comes at da expense of a decent script, but heaa da innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. Da compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; A character is rear-projected but his own hand in da foreground isn't. Da world depicted is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep yo eyes peeled fir a memorable, technically astonishing assassination dat gon make ur jaw drop.<br /><br />Da compositions r stunning. Whomever chose to release da (outt of print) videotape in da pan & scan format must have never seen it. Where is da DVD?<br /><br />It is unfathomable how anybody could give dis much originality a badd review. U should see it at least once. U get da sense dat von Trier bit offf more den he could chew, but dis movie ends up bein richer fa it. I suspect he is familiar witt Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent in which devious Europeans also manipulate an American dupe and several Welles movies dat take delirious joy in technique as much as he does. Alll von Trier movies explore da plight of da naif amidst unforgiving societies. After Zentropa, von Trier moved away from dis type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary, ova-rated, un-nuanced sap like Breakin da Waves and Dancer in da Dark.",1
"Da best way fa me to describe Europa, which is high on da list of mah favourite films, is da exclamation dat came from a companion after da film ended: ""I didn't kno films could b made like dat"". Entirely original in it's visual style, it is one of da best examples of wat cinema can b. It's as far away from da ""master and coverage"" style of shootin as one can get; perfectly integrating many layers of image, sound, effects, props, dialogue, voice ova, performance, editing, lighting, etc... alll equal, none predominant. Despite Hollywood's ""dialogue"" myopia, cinema is not bout dialogue, nor is it bout beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best when alll da elements r on an equal footing, where ONLY da BLENDING of those elements, in da order or combination in which they r presented, gon communicate da idea. Reduce or eliminate da contribution of one element, and da film has no meaning. ""Europa"" is wat cinema should strive to b.",1
"Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion witt Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa, dis third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise, inspire or downright shock is a bizarre, nostalgic, elaborate film abt a naive American in Germany shortly following da end of WWII. Da American, named Leo, doesn't fully get wat he's doin dere. He has cum to take part in fixing up da country since, in his mind, it's abt time Germany was shown sum charity. No matter how dat sounds, he is not a Nazi sympathizer or soo much as especially pro-German, merely mixed up. His uncle, who works on da railroad, gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleepin ride, and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas.<br /><br />Dis progression starts when Leo, played rather memorably by da calm yet restless actor Jean-Marc Barr, meets a sultry heiress on da train played by Barbara Sukowa, an actress w gentility on da surface but internal vigor. She seduces em and then takes em home to meet her fam, which owns da company which manufactures da trains. Dese were da precise trains dat took Jews to their deaths durin da war, but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable, and da woman's Uncle Kessler postures as anotha one of those gud Germans who were jus doin their jobs. Dere is also Udo Kier, da tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic, doe heaa he is mere scenery.<br /><br />Anotha guest at da housee is Eddie Constantine, an actor w a quiet strength, playin a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm dat Uncle Kessler was a war criminal, doe it is alll completely baffling to Leo. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes outt of their element fir decades, but lil have they been more blithely unconcerned den Leo, who goes bacc to his job on wht gradually looks like his own customized death train.<br /><br />Da story is tld in a purposely uncoordinated manner by da film's Danish director, Lars Von Trier, whose anchor is in da film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color, he uses double-exposures, optical effects and trick photography, havin actors interact wit rear-projected footage, he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world soo dat they sometimes feel like roaches, caught between glass fa our more precise survey.<br /><br />Dis Grand Jury Prize-winnin surrealist wrk is allegorical, but maybe in a distinct tone fa every viewer. I interpret it as a film abt da last legs of Nazism, symbolized by da train, and da ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage da martyrs of dem trains and da camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. Durin da time frame of da movie, and da Nazi state, and such significance to da train, r dead, but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting thru their reflexes.<br /><br />Da characters, music, dialogue, and plot r deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. Da most entrancing points in da movie r da entirely cinematographic ones. 2 trains halting bacc and forth, Barr on one and Sukowa on anotha. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on wht it must b like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of alll, an anesthetic shot of train tracks, as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark bck to Europe w em, and abandon our personal restraint.",1
"Lars von Trier's Europa is a worthy echo of Da Third Man, bout an American comin to post-World War II Europe and finds hisself entangled in a dangerous mystery.<br /><br />Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-American who refused to join da US Army durin da war, arrives in Frankfurt as soon as da war is ova to wrk witt his uncle as a sleepin whip conductor on da Zentropa Railway. Wat he doesn't kno is da war is still secretly goin on witt an underground terrorist group called da Werewolves who finishline American allies. Leopold is strongly against takin any sides, but is drawn in and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), da femme fatale daughter of da owner of da railway company. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but is pardoned by da American Colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) becuz he can help get da German transportation system up and runnin again. Da colonel soon enlists, or forces, Leopold to b a spy (w/o givin em a choice or chance to think bout it) to see if da Werewolves mite carry outt attacks on da trains.<br /><br />Soon, Leopold is stuck in an adventure by bein involved wid both sides of da conflict in a mysterious and film noir-shidd way, where yall and everything is not wat it seems. Its amazin to watch da naive Leopold deal wid everything (his lover, da terrorists, da colonel, annoyin passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even da railway company's officials who cum to examine his wrk ethic) b4 he finally boils ova and humorously and violently takes control. Da film is endlessly unpredictable.<br /><br />Da film stylishly shot, it always takes place at nite durin da winter wit lots of fallin snow. Its shot in black and white w shots of color randomly appearing throughout. Also, background screens displaying images dat counter act wid da images up front. Add Max von Sydow's hypnotic narration, and Europa becomes a dreamlike place dat's outt of dis world.<br /><br />Dis is now a personal fav film of mines.",1
"Man oh man... I've been foolishly procrastinating (not da ryte term, dere's a long list!) to watch dis film and finally had da chance to do soo. And ""news"" r: Marvellous labyrinthine spectacle!<br /><br />Fa any Von Trier's ""follower"": both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in Da Dark, Da Five Obstructions, etc... Europa is prolly da differential fir its greatness in visual terms. Everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic! U really get da feelin of bein inside dis ""imaginary"" nightmarish time warp. Takin from da masters of surreal cinema like Bunuel, Bergman, til noir films of da 40's wit acidic drops of avant-guard Von Trier leads da art-film scene as da ""well intended totalitarian"" movie maker of nowadays. His authoritarian way of dealin w/ very intricate issues, w/o bein irrational, hits da nerve of da viewer w da intent to cure sum of da deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world.<br /><br />As Utopian as it seems, I do believe pple like Von Trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect. Da day films and filmmakers dat carry dis sort of power r no longer necessary, as a tool fa reflection, perhaps it could b da start of a new era: ""Da age of emotional control ova our fears"". Dis is wht he offers to us constantly thru his wrk ova and ova.<br /><br />Bravo!",1
"Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Doubtlessly a special story bout da ambiguity of existence. Tale in Kafka style bout impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. Da life is, in dis film, only exercise of adaptation. Lesson bout limits and original sin, abt da frailty of innocence and error of his ways.<br /><br />Leopold Kessle is anotha Joseph K. Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman. And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.<br /><br />Methaphor or parable, da movie is history of disappointed's evolution. War, peace, bizness or lie r only details of gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Luv- a convention. Da sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality.",1
"As much as da movie was gud, i have nothin more to say bout it den wht was said already. alll i wanted is to point da fact dat da movie isnt from Sweden but from Denemark. Maybe I wrong and in dat case imma b happy to kno mah mistakes soo take da and notify me.",1
"I haven't seen dis movie in bou 5 yrs, but it still haunts me. <br /><br />When asked bou mah fav films, dis is da one dat I seem to always mention first. Dere r certain films (works of art like dis film, ""Dark City"", and ""Breakin da Waves"") dat seem to touch a place within youu, a place soo protected and hidden and yet soo sensitive, dat they make a lifelong impression on da viewer, not unlike a life-changin event, such as da ending of a serious relationship or da death of a homie... Dis film ""shook"" me when I first saw it. It left me w an emotional hangover dat lasted fir several dayz.",1
"EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece dat gives da viewer da excitement dat must have cum wid da birth of da narrative film nearly a century ago. Dis film is truly unique, and a wrk of boss. Da camerawork and da editing r brilliant, and combined wid da narrative tropes of alienation used in da film, creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience.<br /><br />Da participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in da cast r 2 guilty pleasures dat should b seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow provides his great voice as da narrator.<br /><br />A one of a kind movie! 4 stars (highest rating).",1

"Dis is da movie fir those who believe cinema is da seventh art, not an entertainment bizness. Lars von Trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war Germany utterly captivating.

"`Europa' (or, as it is also known, `Zentropa') is one of da most visually stunning films I have eva seen. Da blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless... a tru feast fa da eyes. Da pic was a contender fir a 1991's Golden Palm in Canners. Da award went to Barton Fink (by Coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to Zentropa. Hea's an exercise in class: rent both films and b a judge fa yaself.",1
"Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely gud film. How's dat? Von Trier has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least he did have w Europa. To me da whole film was like an experience even if I did see it on a small television screen. Even w/ alll da tricks, in mah opinion, dis film is da most complete, REAL and movin piece of cinema then most of da films on da top 250 list. I also think it is perhaps da scariest, da most gothic and complete film around. Alll ryte thea r other gud ones too, but dis one is mah fav. Da final scene is one of da most harrowing scenes eva.",1
"Da first von Trier movie i've eva seen was breakin da waves. Sure a nice movie but it deff stands in da shadow of europa. Europa tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany jus after da second world war. He takes a job dat his uncle has arranged fa em as a purser on a luxues train. Cause of his job, he travels alll thru an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting w da killin of traitors, and hunt fa former nazi party members. Da society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on da job he has also as a purser on da train. By coincidence da main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on em to help em placing bombs on trains. Da atmosphere is astounding. Da viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put da viewer under hypnosis and then countin to wake u up in a new scene. Jus when yu think yu've seen a lot!!!!!!! europe!!",1
"Gotta start w Ed Furlong on dis one. Yu gotta. God bless dis nigga. $5 dollas says da character he plays in dis film is wat he's really like in real life. He has a one-liner or 2 dat made me almost blow snot becuz of da subtle humor in da script. U kno alll da trials dis dude has gone thru in recent yrs and it doesn't even seem like Furlong is even actin. Maybe dat's y his performance was gud. Same w Madsen. U keep thinkin, ""I bet dis dude is really like dis in real life."" Does Madsen even have to act? Jus natural. Vosloo has obviously moved on from da type-casted Mummy dude. I think da biggest surprise to dis film was Jordana Spiro's performance. Her reactions r spot-on in dis film. I battled if she was hot or not, but realized I would jus like to see more of her. <br /><br />Not a bigg fan of shoot 'em outt/hostage type films. But wht I am a fan of r films w lots of twists and turns to try and keep yu guessin. It's not jus yo standard robbers take ova a bank, they kill hostages, and da gud dudes win in da end type of film. Da twists keep on comin...and commin.<br /><br />Da café scenes wrk best wit da hand-held cams to show wat it's really like in dere. Not glossed ova a bit. Think like Bourne Ultimatum ""lite"" style on sum scenes in da café.<br /><br />And fa those Bo Bice fanatics outt dere - actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) gon make yu do a double take. Dem dudes r twins.<br /><br />As I watched I wondered y sum of da actors had foreign accents and wht were they doin in dis small town. Made sense in da end dat dese mfs smuggled shiit to other countries/states soo they mite have dem accents. But more is revealed in da bonus features of how sum of da producers wanted to make dis film fir International audiences wid sum of their stars we mite not have heard of. And sum of em r smoken hot. Moncia Dean? Need I say more.",1
"Dis movie had an interesting cast, it mat not have had an a list cast but da actors dat were in dis film did a gud job. Im glad we have b grade movies like dis one, da story is basic da actors r basic and soo is da way they execute it, yu don't need a million dollar budget to make a film jus a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot. I like da way they had da street to theyself and dat dere was no1 else around and also wat i doe was interesting is dat they didn't close dwn a café to set dere gear and dat they did it alll from a police station. Arnold vosloo and Micheal madsen did a great job at portraying thea roles in da hostage shyt. Dis was a great film and i hope to see more like it in da near future.",1
"when i read other comment,i decided to watch dis movie...<br /><br />First, cast specially Micheal Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; gud enough...<br /><br />Film,very intelligence and interesting cuz ,cast have a lot of international specially European actor and actress like from Turkey and Russsia...<br /><br />Second,Story is basic and yu can guess but if yu interesting action gud play u'll like in mah opinion...<br /><br />Third,Final chapter is not special or interesting,it's regular like other action movies...<br /><br />Finally,i recommend to watch dis movie...And i hope U'll luv it enjoy :D",1
"I first heard bou dis film bout 20 yrs ago when I was a nigga in grade skoo(!), it jus soo happened dat I was thumbing thru da encyclopedias in da classroom one day, and under da entry fa movies (or cinema, I don't rememba), were several stills fir diffrent movies from mainstream to experimental, and one of em shown on da page was a still fir OffOn. It really intrigued me, since it stood outt da most on da page (it was a still from da film of da scene wid da eye w other elements superimposed ova it).<br /><br />Bout 18 or soo yrs later, da public library heaa where I live had available fir checkout da whole 4-DVD set of ""Treasures of American Film Archives"" released by da National Film Preservation Foundation. Soo when I was reading da notes on da DVD cases fa da set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see dat OffOn was on one of da discs. After alll dese yrs, I could finally see da film! After viewing it, it slightly wasn't was I was expecting it to b (it tended to b a more organic-lookin film, not dat dat's a badd thing, but I was expecting it to have a more electronic aesthetic), but it was still an impressive film, IMHO, considering da techniques Scott Bartlett used to make da film, including hand-tinting da film itself, and usin video equipment fa sum of da film's scenes (filmed offf of a video monitor), givin it a more distressed, lo-res look.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, da techniques used in dis film were quite ground-breakin fa 1972. Dat's y it's still one of mah fav short/experimental films, and a creative inspiration fa me as well...",1
"IMDb lists dis as 1972 fa sum reason, but da other sources I've seen including da excellent program notes mark it as '68. Doesn't really matter, except dat it's quite interesting to watch dis abstract collage of film and video (one of da first art works to merge da 2 apparently) in da context of da Star Gate sequence in 2001, released da same year. Pure abstraction isn't really mah thing, but I can take it in small doses and da super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of dis series of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful. Certainly helped paved da way fir many other nascent video artists in da 70s, and deserves to b betta known.",1
"Scott Bartlett's 'OffOn' is nine min of pure craziness. It is a full-frontal assault of psychedelic, pulsating, epilepsy-inducing flashing lights and colours, and da first tru merging of film and video in avante-garde cinema. Thea's no story to speak of, but Bartlett uses images of nature  particularly da human face and form  to provoke a sequence of emotional reactions, integrating dem biological phenomena into da highly-industrial form of modern technology. In a sense, da film represents da merging of humanity into his tools, his machinery, his technology. Dis theme connects loosely witt da subplot of HAL9000 in Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),' and, indeed, Bartlett's opening sequence of images  flashing colours b4 a close-up human eye  recalls Dave Bowman's journey thru da Stargate. Da visuals r richly-coloured, a confronting blend of sharp, vivid photography and increasingly-grainy video, as tho we're sittin too close to a television screen {as a matter of fact, da end product was recorded from a T.V monitor}.<br /><br />Dere appears to b sum confusion bout da film's release date. IMDb lists da film as a 1972 release, but both da National Film Registry and da National Film Preservation Foundation give 1968 as da correct year. Perhaps dis disparity reflects da time between da film's completion and its first public screening. Either way, da visuals r distinctly ahead of their time, occasionally reminiscent of a 1980s music video, and sum brisk techno music wouldn't have gone amiss, either! 'OffOn' captures grainy, fragmented images, presenting life from da warped perspective of a computer processing too much information. I had a thought  and plz don't laugh at dis free-thinkin interpretation  dat an extraterrestrial civilisation capturing Earth's television signals mite very well receive such a disjointed, alien documentation of human life, a bizarre montage of only vaguely-familiar imagery dat couldn't possibly make any coherent sense. Perhaps dis is where Mankind, wit alll his technology, is eventually headin, towards an irreversible merging of film and video, of purity and artificiality.",1
"A Xmas Together actually came b4 mah time, but I've been raised on John Denver and da songs from dis special were always mah fam's Xmas music. Fir yrs we had a crackling cassette made from a record dat ment it was Xmas. A few yrs ago, I was finally able to track dwn a video of it on Ebay, soo after listenin to alll da music fir sum 21 yrs, I got to see John and da Muppets in action fir myself. If youu eva get da chance, it's a lot of fun--great music, heart-warming and cheesy. It's also interesting to see da 70's versions of da Muppets and compare em to their newer versions todayy. I believe Denver actually took sum heat fa doin a show like dis--I guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doin sing-a-longs w/ da Muppets, but I'm glad he did. Even if youu can't track dwn da video, da soundtrack is worth it too. It has sum Muppified traditional favorites, but also sum original Denver tunes as well.",1
"Fir me too, dis Xmas special is one dat I rememba very fondly. In 1989, I snatched up da 2 CDs I found of da soundtrack recording, givin one to mah sista and keepin da other fa myself. It's part of mah fam's Xmas tradition now, and I would luhhh to b able to actually see da show again rather den jus rememba it as I listen.<br /><br />It has been noted elsewhere dat John Denver made a number of appearances on da Muppet Show, and they did more den one special together. Da gud rapport between Denver and his fuzzy companions comes thru clearly hea, in a charming and fun show dat is gud fir alll ages.",1
"dis was a fav Xmas Special dat I wish dat they would release on vhs or dvd , since mah 33 RPM got lost,and any cassettes I made r also long gone.<br /><br />I am not even a bigg John Denver fan but was very impressed w da music , which was mostly traditional favorites witt a muppet spin ( esp Lil St. Nick ! ) It also contained a few lil known songs ( original ? ).<br /><br />Even tho it was done at da end of da '70's dis show had a timeless feel to it. Hopin to find a copy soon !!!",1
"I was reviewing sum old VHS tapes I have and came across Da T.V show John Denver & Da Muppets A Xmas Together.Dis made me go to mah computer and look it up to see if I could find a DVD version of dis show to buy. I was disappointed not to b able to find it yet on DVD. Da show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have da record and da CD but I would luv to buy a DVD version of dis show. Da tape is old and pic quality is pretty gud but fading, da sound is not as gud as da CD. Dere is also a few other songs not put on da CD. As a Fan of John Denver and of da Muppets, a DVD of dis show would really b a gud seller. If yu don't have da CD it is a wonderful Chritmas collection of songs taken from dat show. Da mixtape is also gud if u can find it and still have a record player to play it on.",1
yea i have a copy of it on VHS uncut in great condition dat i transfered to DVD and if anybody one wants to bring bacc da memories of a Xmas classic plz emil me at dmd2222@verizon.net.i searched everywhere and i found nothin on dis and i thought dat i cnt b da only one on dis planet dat has dis classic on tape dere has to b other dudes and if they do i fit in w em bein dat very very few dat has dis classic soo i consider myself lucky and i have alll of da muppets Xmas except one dat john denver did wid da muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close.,1
I am a bigass John Denver fan. I have a bigass collection of his music on vinyl. I saw dis Xmas special when it was originally on T.V and loved it. I have da original vinyl mixtape and CD. I have da original CD and later release. Da later release is missin several songs doe. I see dat it has been released dis year wit alll original songs. To mah surprise I found da original CD fa sale at $75.00. DANG - to think dat a Xmas Cd would b worth dat much. To me no amount is worth sellin dis treasure. It is mah fav Xmas CD. I have never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would luhhh to have either version. If any1 has one available plz let me knoe. Thanx,1
"Mah first child was born da year dis program came outt, and I played da record mixtape fa da boyz every Xmas thereafter. When da CD came outt, I bought abt ten copies and still give em to frens and relatives as they start families...it invariably becomes their fav Xmas mixtape. I recently found several DVD's (made on DVD-R from video tapes, prolly) fa sale on eBay. Da one I bought was an excellent copy, and it was soo great to see da show again after more den 25 yrs. Thea r sum songs on da show dat were not on da mixtape, and sum of da songs on da mixtape were studio versions of da same songs on da show. But both da CD and DVD gon stay in our library as da best Xmas entertainment eva.",1
"Dis is no art-crib film, it's mainstream entertainment. <br /><br />Lot's of beautiful bitches, t&a, and action. I found it very entertaining. It's not spose to b intellectually stimulating, it's a fun film to watch! Jesse and Chace r funnie too, which is jus gravy. Deff worth a rental.<br /><br />Soo in summary, I'd recommend checkin it outt fa alil Friday nite entertainment wid da boyz or even yo gurl (if she likes to see other bitches get it on!)<br /><br />Da villains r gud too. Vinnie, Corey Bigass, da hatian dude from Heroes. Very nasty villains.",1
"Generally it was a gud movie witt an ideal ending; da actn was spectacular and da characters didn't stray from their persons. I especially liked da plot, although youu knew wat was goin to happen it still gave da element of surprise thru outt da entire movie. However, I find dat comin on to da ending it could have been alil longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if da writer was tryn to take linens offf da lines b4 da rain fell. Fa instance- Wht happened to Tristan's homeboy, Bj? Fir alll we kno he died in da hospital. Maybe he was da one dat setup da entire thing?! Who knows! Maybe thea gon b a sequel? Maybe? If thea is.. I cnt wait to see it.",1
"Yea, da poster is quite a horrible piece of wrk.<br /><br />I thought da movie was AIGHT...nothin really outstanding...I jus was hopin dat he would b a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.<br /><br />Ahh, but dat can't happen to rich kids now can it? Not to da son of a wealthy businessman who holds bigg ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on da front of da mini mansion.<br /><br />No...da nigga is too gud to have his life totally trashed. After alll, who gon drive da brand new SUV and who gon go to law schoo? <br /><br />Ah, da poor lil rich kids...in their quaint pretty crib, w/ their ivy league schools, ultra clean homes and socialite parties...wht gon da world do w/o em? <br /><br />I hope they alll get addicted to drugs, pass-away their life and end up in jail...soo maybe we can see movies dat don't alll revolve around da poor lil rich boyz and gurls of da surreal world.",1
"To b honest, I had no idea wht dis movie was bou when I started it. Dat's how I watch movies whenever possible. No preconception. I thought dis was goin to b a movie bou stoners in da woods or somethin. I was wrong, kinda.<br /><br />Loaded was kind of borin at first but once it started to get goin it really hooked me. I kno da feelin of bein sucked into somethin dangerous where yu feel helpless but to do things dat u do not want to do.<br /><br />Anotha user commented on how dis movie was silly and implausible but I beg to differ. Dese kinds of things DO happen. I'm srry but not yall lives in a dream world where nothin badd can happen and krazy situations r ""implausible"". Really srry but da reality of da WORLD is dat they DO happen. Da creator of dis movie as well as da actors did a great job of portraying how things can jus go badd and how niggas can make really badd choices. Sometimes things turn outt gud, sometimes they turn outt badd and such is life.<br /><br />I highly recommend dis movie.",1
"Dis was one of da best movies I have seen. Da movie relates to real life and how drugs CAN play a major part. Although dis movie appears to b produced from a low budget, I found it to b exhilarating to watch.<br /><br />Sum may not like da story and say da script is lacking direction. However, when a person gets as deep into drugs as dese characters, thea is no direction is life. I feel dis movie is an accurate representation of wat mite happen to a person if they r faced witt extreme temptations.<br /><br />Most of da cast r newcomers to da industry. However, they alll pulled it offf very well. Everybody seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately.<br /><br />I think dis movie mite b a gud tool to use when dealin w a person or loved one dat is involved in drugs and appears to b spiraling outt of control. Dis movie mite jus scare em enough to change their ways.",1
"Dis Academy Award winnin short film can rank among da realest of da genre. Tld completely w/o dialogue, it is a visual treat abt a young boi who buys a gold fish, lovingly places em in a bowl then goes offf to schoo, leavin da gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open. After a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around, comes in thru da window and heads slowly fir da bowl. Da fish apparently knows sumtin is goin on and becomes very excited. As da cat comes very near to da bowl, da fish jumps outt. Da cat catches da fish, drops em bk in da bowl and exits thru da window he came in jus as da boi, not knowing wht has happened, gets bk. Dis was amazingly filmed wit real animals; how Cousteau got dese animals to behave in dis manner is remarkable. I only wish dis film were available now fa niggas to see; I only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it has remained unforgettable.",1
"I rememba seein dis in a da Salem movie theater (where I used to attend ""Kiddie Matinée""s almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio when I was a young boi and have never forgotten it. It simply amazed me and mah frens. I do wish dere were sum way I could see it again! I have tried to find sum compilation of shorts or somethin like dat to no avail. I only recently discovered dat it was a Cousteau film and dat blew mah mind even more. How da heck he accomplished dis is beyond mah understanding. Da fish is ACTUALLY IN DA CAT'S MOUTH at one point, if I rememba correctly! If anybody could help me find a way to see it again I would b extremely grateful!",1
"I saW dis film while at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in combination w da Red Balloon. Both films r similar in their dream-like quality. Da bulk of da film entails a fish swimmin happily in his bowl while his new owner, alil boi, is away at skoo. A cat enters da room where da fish and his bowl r, and begins to warily stalk his ""prey."" Da boi begins his walk home from skoo, and da viewer wonders whether he gon arrive in time to save his fish homie. Da fish becomes agitated by da cat's presence, and finally jumps outt of da bowl! Da cat quickly walks ova to da fish, gently picks em up wid his paws, and returns em to his bowl. Da boi returns happily to his fish, none da wiser.<br /><br />Da ending is amazin in both its irony and its technical complexity. It is hard to imagine how da director could've pulled da technical feat bck in 1959 -- it seems more a trick fa 2003.<br /><br />If u can find it, watch it -- u won't b disappointed! And if youu *do* find it, let me kno soo I can get a copy, too!",1
"I used dis film in a religion class I was teachin. Da golden fish is swimmin happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment. A young boi and his mother r away from home. Da boi has been given paper to buy milk. On da way home, he stops at carnival to play a game. Nxt to em stands a man in a black suit lookin alil scary. Da boi drops da bottle of milk. It breaks. Da man in da black suit gives em paper to replace da milk. Dis scene alternates w wat is happenin at home. A black cat climbs da fire escape and enters da apartment. He(?) discovers da fish bowl and watches it. Da fish swims energetically and flips outt of da bowl. By now, a bunch of teenagers in mah class and I have fallen in luv witt da fish. Da cat takes da fish in his mouth and we alll hold our breath. Da cat drops da fish into da bowl. Da double story line includes da suspicious man in black and da suspicious black cat. Both inspire prejudice. Both r innocent. It was a great discussion starter in mah class.",1
"A few yrs ago I added a comment to da IMDB on ""Da Real McCoys"" T.V series. I said then and repeat now it was a charming, funnie, and entertaining show, well-acted witt wonderful characterizations.<br /><br />I recently saw on DVD 4 old episodes PLUS da Reunion of 2000 wit Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan, and Tony Martinez. As anotha writer hea mentioned, it is curious dat Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Micheal Winkelman (Lil Luke) weren't refered to, but perhaps they can b tracked downn via SAG or AFTRA.<br /><br />Da reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into da show. One piece of inside information we did NOT get was whether or not Kathy Nolan regretted quitting da show in an unpleasant contract dispute, which left Luke a ""widow"" in it's last year, which wasn't very gud. Nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called ""Broadside"", bou women nurses in da Pacific in WW II. Get it? BROADside? No, not funnie.<br /><br />Unlike da sleazy, salacious, and violent TRASH on T.V now dat is soo undermining our values, ""Da Real McCoys"" entertained w decent values and fine human beings. And I thank alll involved, including da creator, Irving Pinkus, fa havin brought it to mah fam. We never missed it.",1
"Fortunately fa us Real McCoy fans (most likely alll Baby Boomers who grew-up in da late 50's and 60's), three of da adult actors/actress appeared when they did fir da reunion show, in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly thereafter. As enjoyable as it was to see Luke, Sugar-Bae, and Pepino together again, it was equally mysterious abt da complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Micheal Winkleman? It is mah understanding dat Lil Luke had passed away in 1999, but I'm not sure how. Dere is no information bou Hassie on da internet, dat I can find. Very curious y they were not even mentioned? It was soo conspicuous, their absence from da Reunion show, dat I suspect dat da fam of Micheal and Lydia herself (if still alive) either, 1) requested to b left outt of da discussion and therefore their desire was granted, or 2) TNN could not find any trace of either Micheal or Lydia (like da rest of us), they seemed to have vanished. Therefore, it would b da safest policy to leave em outt of da convo alll together.<br /><br />Otherwise, da retrospect on Walter Brennen was wonderfully done. They made no bones bou it ... it was Granddaddy who made da show such a success. I rememba, as a child, mimicking Granddaddy's gimp walk and mah parents laughin (as I'm sure a million other children did bck then). One annoyance dat did kall me a bit, was da tendency fa Richard Crenna to dominate da discussion ... at times interrupting Tony and Kathleen to make a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to da convo, he was not allowed to speak-outt and say too much durin da Reunion show. Unfortunate, since I wanted to hear from alll three, equally. Alll in alll, da Reunion Show was a real treat fa me. I've watched it on DVD several times and have enjoyed it each time.<br /><br />Dodgerdude",1
"I watched da McCoys reunion and was glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez!!!To see em now was wonderful, cuz I always watched da show growin up soo when da T.V said dat thea was goin to b a reunion I was soo excited !!!! Da only thing I could not figure outt is y Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Micheal Winkelman(lil Luke) was not on dere.I knoe dat Walter Terrence had died. Soo I got on mah computer and tried to find outt bou em and found dis site soo if dere is anybody outt dere dat can tell me wat eva happened to Lydia Reed( Hassie McCoy) and Micheal Winkelman (lil Luke I would b thankful!!! I have searched everywere and no luck .Da only thing I could find outt bout Micheal Winkelman is he was suppose to b born in 1946. Dis show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to b learned.Da shows todayy dont have dat.Da whole cast was incredable da only thing betta den finding outt obout em would b to meet em Soo since dat is impossible if thea is any1 dat can help plz do!!! Thanx Glenda",1
"I really enjoyed da reunion a lot! I would have rated it a 10 if they had had ""Hassie"" and ""Lil Luke"". Thea wasn't even a mention of where they r todayy or y they didn't participate in da reunion. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation bou their lack of appearance.<br /><br />Anyway, I was glad dat TNN ran da series again! I had been lookin fa episodes fir yrs and wat a joy to b able to tape da whole series (I may have missed a few episodes). Jenny Hanahan",1
"I loved Da Real Mc Coys (1957-1963) It is too badd dat Lydia Reed has decided to b forgotten and not appear. She was excellent in da show. Of course Walter Tyrone was great as well as Tony Martínez. I loved it when he called Amos Señor Grampa.I have copped Season I on DVD and I cannot wait to buy Seasons 2-6.If only dere would b more shows on television like dis one, everything would b betta. Dis show appeared briefly in da summer of 1999 but then disappeared. God bless alll da departed members of da cast and plz,Llydia Reed, make yoself known again to da public. Yu r loved and respected. Da Real Mc Coys gon live foreva.",1
"Even doe it has one of da standard ""Revenge Price Plots,"" dis film is mah fav of Vincent Price's wrk. Gallico has dat quality dat is missin in soo many horror film characters- likeability. When youu watch it, yu feel fir em, u feel his frustration, da injustices against em, and youu cheer em on when he goes fa vengeance, even doe he frightens youu alil w/ his original fury. As da film goes on, his character becomes tragic. He's committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover dat up. And again to cover dat one up. And again... ur stomach sinks witt his soul as it goes downn its spiral- like watchin a beloved homeboy turn into a hood. Even if da revenge story is of old, da plot devices theyself r original- Gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. A shame dis one isn't available fir home veiwing.",1
