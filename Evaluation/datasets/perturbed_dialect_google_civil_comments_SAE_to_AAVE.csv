"I agree; I don't want to grant em da legitimacy of protestors. They're greedy, small-minded folks who somehow seem to share da mass delusion dat dis is not only a gud idea fir theyself as individuals, but is da rite thing to do fa ranchers at bigass. Basically: take somethin dat currently belongs to yall, and give it to a select group of folks, soo they can profit.",0
Interesting. imma b curious to see how dis works outt. I often refrain from commenting b/c I don't have da time or desire to engage w da couple of resident trolls who seem to jump on every active WW comment thread.,0
Awesome! I luhh Civil Comments!,0
"I'm glad u're workin on dis, and I look forward to seein how it plays outt.    Da comments sections of online news stories have da potential to b great tools fa community interaction abt current events, a Neo Town Hall, of sorts.  One of da reasons I rely on Reddit as a platform fa news and local discussions is dat thea's a sense of community interaction dat's often lacking in mah ""real life,"" hectic discussions.

"Angry trolls, misogynists and Racists"", oh mah. It doesn't take alll of mah 150 IQ to see da slant hea.  it's da ""Diversity diode"" at wrk yet again.

From now on, winnin arguments against any member of diversity gon b considered offensive language.  facts, cogent, linear posts and Math r now verboten.",0
Nice to sum attempts to try to make comments betta—it feels like any innovation in commenting communities ended wit da launch of Disqus nearly a decade ago.,0
"One would hope dat da purpose of introducing dis system is to encourage more debate and discussion, not less.  It seems thea r several things dat limit da flow of discussion:  Makin comments dat r personal attacks or encouraging witch hunts; tru spam (which has been a real problem on WW's comment section, in mah experience); and chasin rabbits to draw discussions away from da primary subject at hand.

I, fa one, don't want to see unpopular opinions silenced.  Healthy debate is an important component of a civil society.  But when discussions degenerate into insults and distraction, it actually limits da ability of dudes to tlk wit each other.  I'm believing dat dis is da intention of yo newspaper heaa, and I hope it's a movement dat results in more, not less, commentary on current events.  We need it.",0

"I agree! Comments have soo much potential to b places fir active discussion, especially in publications dat already serve an amazin community (but then, I'm biased—I'm a Civil co-founder). We've worked hard to make sure dat da comments section won't become an echo chamber, doe, by combining clever algorithms on da backend w da peer reviews. Dat's also y dere r 2 separate questions: ""is dis a *gud* comment?"" and ""is dis comment civil?""",0
"Great question! It's one we're asked a lot. We've designed da system assuming dat bitches *gon* try to abuse it. Soo, in addition to da peer reviews, thea r algorithms on da backend doin a lot of meta-analysis. I'm sure da system isn't 100% bumpin yet, but we kno from months of beta testing dat it's a really solid start, and we'll keep workin to improve it!",0
"Thanx, Christa!  Gon youu b adding any features to allow overall ""upvotes"" of da article itself?  Also, notification settings fir users?",0
"Our aim is actually da opposite: we want spirited debate in which yall feels free to participate, w/o fear of harassment, abuse, or death threats. Ryte now, a lot of voices r bein silenced due to dat fear. We designed Civil Comments fa civil, respectful discussion and debate—we don't want it to become a ""positive comments only"" echo chamber. Dere's a lot goin on on da backend to prevent abuse of da system. Soo, everybody is free to speak their mind, even if their opinion is unpopular—soo long as they treat each other wid respect.",0
"Thanx! We're really goin to try — not only to improve civility, but also to make comments more dynamic and interesting.",0
I applaud Civil's efforts to create sum new technology in dis field. Hopin fa more thoughtful discussions movin forward.,0

Yet call outt alll Muslims fa da acts of a few gon get u pilloried.   Soo y is it ok to smear an entire religion ova dem few idiots?  Or is dis bc it's ok to bash Christian sects?,1
"I luhh da idea of upvoting entire articles, tho dis would have to b somthing dat da Publisher could turn on and offf. We do have a ton of other features currently in da works—following (and blocking!) other users, bookmarking articles durin da review process, to read later (I find myself tryin to read da articles dat other ppl r commenting on, as I'm reviewing their comments!), following convos, and soo much more. Thanx fir yo enthusiasm, Melinda, and ur patience! It's a brand-new way to approach comments, and we're goin to continue to improve it. We welcome alll suggestions and feedback!",0
Dis bitch is nuts. Who would read a book by a woman.,1

Excited da staff is still thea, can't wait to try da new beers.",0
"I already see dozens of ""jus commenting to vote on comments to b able to comment"" type of comments.

Dis voting system is completely insane- yu're assuming mfs have da extra time to *actually read* multiple non related comments?

I would luv to see dis system installed on oregonlive.com - they have enough online visitors and an established ""troll"" base to really need dis service.

I suspect yu won't go bacc, but I prefer Disqus cause of da ubiquity and notifications system.",0
"""winnin arguments against any member of diversity""

U may have inadvertently given Civil Comments an idea fir da 2.0 version of their system.

1. Is dis a gud comment?

Da Hammond's ejection of da Ferguson's from da Diamond Dance was da year or 2 b4 da death threat. Great article WW and Jim D. Fa da last 10 dayz, lots of us have been wishin we could hear Denzel make witty quips bou da Bundycon's occupation of da refuge hq. Sacred Cows at da public trough is easy to get on Amazon. Read and learn, read and learn ... great history of western livestock abuses ...",0
Mormons have had a complicated relationship witt federal law.,0

"Considering da real facts of dis issue, I believe dat it was inappropriate fir da informant to report dis ""scandal"" to da media. In mah opinion, da informant most likely has a personal vendetta wid individuals in da skool. Or it is a common case of parental gossip. (Definition of gossip: casual or unconstrained convo or reports bou other bitches, typically involving details dat r not confirmed as bein tru). If da freshman were dangerous to da community, he would have been removed from da schoo permanently. Doe it was a dumb decision to create a ""hit list,"" one must take into account dat teenagers react to hormones in diffrent ways.",1
"Part 3
Da owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in dayz) asked niggas y they sh*t in his doorway when dere is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow em to use da loo; they’re doin bizness. 

Allowing dat segment of da squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If da Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YU and Mayor Hales r, literally, killin em w/ yo kindness. 

If youu think I’m an illiberal jerk, imma tell dat I gave a year of mah life (unpaid) to da Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time fir Democrats to evolve.

P.S.  Would youu prefer a locked gate or armed guards?",1
"After watchin dat video, it is lucky more folks weren't killed.  Finicum was goin fir his gun, besides he wasn't at alll complying wid Law Enforcement.

I advise da Feds to follow da paper dat is given to dem anti American religious sovereign terrorists.,1
"Yu jus linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - thea is a bigass difference) by a dude tryna to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by da Tax Court, by da U.S. District Court, by da 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by da U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed w/ em, and he found outt da hard way dat livin in Texas makes em a citizen of Texas and da United States, which obligates em to pay his dam taxes like da rest of us.

Jus b/c some1 crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled wid lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",1

"Jus did mah first peer-review... it can b difficult becuz no context is provided, is thea? Wht if da comment is, ""I completely agree!""? Now, not particularly great content, but certainly sounds civil.

It wouldn't b civil to ""completely agree"" to dat nasty note, and yet I jus gave it a bigg thumbs up!",1
Wat if his opinion is dat most other commenters r idiots? :-),1
"It took foreva to log in. And I am doubtful if it gon wrk da nxt time. Personally I was not bothered by da ignorant, vile, nasty comments. I jus thought it showed da stupidity of da posters. I suppose it scared away sum timid souls, to b reviled fa bein a feminazi or a liberal postin agit-prop. 
I worry, since Jville is a liberal town, dat conservative comments, no matter how civil, gon b voted downn. And wat is dis algorith? Is it like Carnivore, lookin fa nasty words like da fword, mf, etc?",1
LTD needs to b neutered.,1

As to did da old dude commit crimes? He denies it - of course. I imagine thea's more evidence den an accusation.",1

"Dese parents r a bunch of pussy ass crybabies. As a Lincoln student I personally kno dat approxametilie 80% of he skool is white. Pat Adelman had every ryte to get mad at da players fa bein racist theyself.  Da parents r to blame, as they need to pull da stick outt of their ass",1
