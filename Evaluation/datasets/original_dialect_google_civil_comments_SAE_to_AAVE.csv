"This is so cool. It's like, 'would you want your mother to read this??' Really great idea, well done!",0
"Thank you!! This would make my life a lot less anxiety-inducing. Keep it up, and don't let anyone get in your way!",0
This is such an urgent design problem; kudos to you for taking it on. Very impressive!,0
Is this something I'll be able to install on my site? When will you be releasing it?,0
haha you guys are a bunch of losers.,1
The ranchers seem motivated by mostly by greed; no one should have the right to allow their animals destroy public land.,0
It was a great show. Not a combo I'd of expected to be good together but it was.,0
"Wow, that sounds great.",0
"This is a great story. Man. I wonder if the person who yelled ""shut the fuck up!"" at him ever heard it.",0
This seems like a step in the right direction.,0
"It's ridiculous that these guys are being called ""protesters"". Being armed is a threat of violence, which makes them terrorists.",1
"This story gets more ridiculous by the hour! And, I love that people are sending these guys dildos in the mail now. But… if they really think there's a happy ending in this for any of them, I think they're even more deluded than all of the jokes about them assume.",0
"I agree; I don't want to grant them the legitimacy of protestors. They're greedy, small-minded people who somehow seem to share the mass delusion that this is not only a good idea for themselves as individuals, but is the right thing to do for ranchers at large. Basically: take something that currently belongs to everyone, and give it to a select group of people, so they can profit.",0
Interesting. I'll be curious to see how this works out. I often refrain from commenting because I don't have the time or desire to engage with the couple of resident trolls who seem to jump on every active WW comment thread.,0
Awesome! I love Civil Comments!,0
"I'm glad you're working on this, and I look forward to seeing how it plays out.    The comments sections of online news stories have the potential to be great tools for community interaction about current events, a Neo Town Hall, of sorts.  One of the reasons I rely on Reddit as a platform for news and local discussions is that there's a sense of community interaction that's often lacking in my ""real life,"" hectic discussions.  

But hopefully we won't be tempted to silence those who take unpopular stances.",0
"Angry trolls, misogynists and Racists"", oh my. It doesn't take all of my 150 IQ to see the slant here.  it's the ""Diversity diode"" at work yet again. ""We can say anything that we want because we are Diversity. You on the other hand must only  say what we allow you to say. From now on, winning arguments against any member of diversity will be considered offensive language.  facts, cogent, linear posts and Math are now verboten.",0
Nice to some attempts to try to make comments better—it feels like any innovation in commenting communities ended with the launch of Disqus nearly a decade ago.,0
"One would hope that the purpose of introducing this system is to encourage more debate and discussion, not less.  It seems there are several things that limit the flow of discussion:  Making comments that are personal attacks or encouraging witch hunts; true spam (which has been a real problem on WW's comment section, in my experience); and chasing rabbits to draw discussions away from the primary subject at hand.

I, for one, don't want to see unpopular opinions silenced.  Healthy debate is an important component of a civil society.  But when discussions degenerate into insults and distraction, it actually limits the ability of people to talk with each other.  I'm believing that this is the intention of your newspaper here, and I hope it's a movement that results in more, not less, commentary on current events.  We need it.",0
"Comments will be randomly chosen and be reviewed by more than one person. But I bet the Civil people have an even better, more thorough answer to this question!",0
She would be a major improvement for city council and she has a long history of giving all citizens a voice. She is a problem solver that is what Portland needs .,0
"I agree! Comments have so much potential to be places for active discussion, especially in publications that already serve an amazing community (but then, I'm biased—I'm a Civil co-founder). We've worked hard to make sure that the comments section won't become an echo chamber, though, by combining clever algorithms on the backend with the peer reviews. That's also why there are two separate questions: ""is this a *good* comment?"" and ""is this comment civil?""",0
"Great question! It's one we're asked a lot. We've designed the system assuming that people *will* try to abuse it. So, in addition to the peer reviews, there are algorithms on the backend doing a lot of meta-analysis. I'm sure the system isn't 100% perfect yet, but we know from months of beta testing that it's a really solid start, and we'll keep working to improve it!",0
"Thanks, Christa!  Will you be adding any features to allow overall ""upvotes"" of the article itself?  Also, notification settings for users?",0
"Our aim is actually the opposite: we want spirited debate in which everyone feels free to participate, without fear of harassment, abuse, or death threats. Right now, a lot of voices are being silenced due to that fear. We designed Civil Comments for civil, respectful discussion and debate—we don't want it to become a ""positive comments only"" echo chamber. There's a lot going on on the backend to prevent abuse of the system. So, everyone is free to speak their mind, even if their opinion is unpopular—so long as they treat each other with respect.",0
"Thanks! We're really going to try — not only to improve civility, but also to make comments more dynamic and interesting.",0
I applaud Civil's efforts to create some new technology in this field. Hoping for more thoughtful discussions moving forward.,0
Why bother writing a review if it's going to be this devoid of content?  I understand that you work for WW. (but that hardly seems like an excuse when Fred Armisen recorded radio voices for Grand Theft Auto IV with the same number of people.),0
Yet call out all Muslims for the acts of a few will get you pilloried.   So why is it okay to smear an entire religion over these few idiots?  Or is this because it's okay to bash Christian sects?,1
"I love the idea of upvoting entire articles, though this would have to be something that the Publisher could turn on and off. We do have a ton of other features currently in the works—following (and blocking!) other users, bookmarking articles during the review process, to read later (I find myself wanting to read the articles that other people are commenting on, as I'm reviewing their comments!), following conversations, and so much more. Thanks for your enthusiasm, Melinda, and your patience! It's a brand-new way to approach comments, and we're going to continue to improve it. We welcome all suggestions and feedback!",0
This bitch is nuts. Who would read a book by a woman.,1
"Not for long!  

(Troll-In-Training since 2016)",0
Commenting for the sake of commenting to rate other comments to better comment on our new comment system.,0
"Pity the menu lost so much vegan food! The Mash Tun was a favorite beer bar for all the delicious tempeh stuff.
Excited the staff is still there, can't wait to try the new beers.",0
"I already see dozens of ""just commenting to vote on comments to be able to comment"" type of comments.

This voting system is completely insane- you're assuming people have the extra time to *actually read* multiple non related comments?

I would love to see this system installed on oregonlive.com - they have enough online visitors and an established ""troll"" base to really need this service.

With as little online activity as wweek has - it will discourage further growth here.",0
Very cool project!,0
Awesome! Signed up just to give this a shot... good luck to your enterprise!,0
"disqus has way more functionality and obviously a huge following - it can increase visitor count significantly.

disqus also has a moderator feature - a feature that wweek either never wanted to pay their staff to undertake, or never developed a group of people they could trust to do it on their behalf on a volunteer basis.",0
"YET ANOTHER BARACK OBAMA LIBERAL MEDIA CONSPIRACY BY THE THOUGHT CONTROL POLICE. I DIDENT SPEND 30 YEARS MIXING CONCRETE TO LET AMERICA FALL TO THE COMMIES. THE TAXES HERE ARE SO HIGH I CANT EVEN AFFORD A KEYBOARD WITH A WORKING CAPS LOCK. PORTLAND HAS BEEN GOING DOWNHILL FOR YEARS, NO WONDER THE TEA PARTY IS MAKING A COMEBACK. WHATS NEXT FLOURAIDE IN THE WATER SUPPLY?",0
I haven't seen the kind of comments you're mentioning. I'm interested in where this system works and where it's having problems. Do you have a link you could share that has comments like you mentioned?,0
I'm crazy about that illustration! I never would have thought to pitch everything so yellow and orange.,0
"wmcelha, there are several new and exciting vegan and gluten free options on the new menu!  Buffalo tostones are a fun, vegan, gluten free, soy free option.  Not to mention a killer new veggie burger, vegan tacos, and several nice salads.  Hope to see you there soon!",0
"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I love WW content but the comment section has polluted for far too long. The lack of community moderation gave a loud megaphone to a small number of right wing trolls.",0
Probably because they consistently waste funds on trendy projects like green bike boxes -- which cost a fortune and have to be repainted every couple of years.  Oy.,0
"The system is set up so if traffic is slow, an algorithm takes over until it picks up.",0
Because the people who drive cars more are the ones who cause more wear and tear on the roads?  Pretty fair and straightforward.,0
"Tried this out on another post.  Having to rate three other comments and then my own - is the lead designer a big Foucault fan?  Feels like panopticomments.

I suspect you won't go back, but I prefer Disqus because of the ubiquity and notifications system.",0
"""winning arguments against any member of diversity""

You may have inadvertently given Civil Comments an idea for the 2.0 version of their system.

1. Is this a good comment?

2. Is this comment civil?

3. Did this comment totally just win the argument???",0
"I had a little trouble getting signed up, but after a brief email exchange with the folks at Civil everything appears to be working now.  If they're successful in their goal, I'll be extremely pleased.",0
"Are you taxed as a resident of the state you were in when you bought the ticket, or as a resident of the state you are in when you claim the ticket?

If it's the latter, I suppose a theoretical lucky Oregonian will have to decide whether it's worth $90m in exchange for being stuck with the hated ""Californian"" moniker.",0
"The letter writing campaign to get livestock off of Malheur Refuge started in the late '70's. The death threat phoned in to Nancy and Denzel's home was in 1979; along with two other friends I was hired a bodyguard to help protect N&D that weekend. The Hammond's ejection of the Ferguson's from the Diamond Dance was the year or two before the death threat. Great article WW and Jim D. For the last 10 days, lots of us have been wishing we could hear Denzel make witty quips about the Bundycon's occupation of the refuge hq. Sacred Cows at the public trough is easy to get on Amazon. Read and learn, read and learn ... great history of western livestock abuses ...",0
Mormons have had a complicated relationship with federal law.,0
"I've been loosely following Civil Comments since it was announced late last year; I even tried a beta demonstration. One thing I've been wondering is: will users will have to sign up for new profiles on any site that uses Civil, or do you have one Civil profile that you'd use on any partner site?",0
My sign-up just now couldn't have been smoother!,0
Love that they also participate in the Portland Farmer's Market at PSU... and trying to gluten-shame Tastebud and propping Papa Murphy's in the same sentence is laughable.,1
"Took this as an opportunity to check back in on The Yard and the floorpans are finally up and they are ATROCIOUS.  Yeah, because I want to spend 2500+ to share a thin wall with my roommate.  Oh, and I want to pick between a dining table OR living room set, because in this modern world you can't have both.  And if you do want both, one is going to be in a tiny spot by your door and the other is going to be down a long hallway of useless square ft next to your kitchenette.  So dumb.

"Their ridiculous band photo has me wanting to drink white wine at 3 in the afternoon.
It's almost 5, right?",1
"""Anybody who can kiss that many asses, that quickly, is so primed for success in the American workplace that they don't need your crappy restaurant job."" 

^This.

Also, having been both the chatty person and the languishing-in-line-behind-the-chatty-person person, I think the best thing to do is smile and get over it.",1
Metro has lied to us from the beginning about what this money would really fund. What a pile of lies. Makes me sick that my money is paying for the captivity and forced breeding of these wild animals. I want a refund Metro - you are liars!,1
You're an idiot.,1
Who cares!? Stark trek and Star Wars fans are all dorks who never get laid.,1
"Nincompoop, that's a nice one! I'm partial to silly goose.",1
"Sorry to have to do this, but just to see if profanity filtering is enabled: fuck.",1
Troll trolly troll. What now?,1
"THIS IS A TEST: 

Any fool knows Star Trek is the best albeit lacking the technology available to more recent shows. Your post is total crap. 

That's not what I really think or how I talk...just giving you a crap comment :)",1
"testing purposes: 

you are an idiot and i can't stand ignorant donutholes.",1
The Troll is strong with this one.,1
"For the purposes of testing, here's my contribution:

lol wut wat a bunch of bullshit

the author is a delusional stupid jerk full of crap

(I just can't bring myself to use stronger profanity and personal attacks.)",1
People can use toothpaste if they so desire and then spit it out. It's stupid to subject every cell in the body to one of the most toxic substances on the earth by swallowing fluoride.,1
"Well shit, they drafted a guide.  We should all be good now, whew aht a relief...",1
So tired of all these Portlanders moving to California and ruining the culture.  When will it stop?!?,1
"This is what a serious mental illness looks like, a sociopathic paranoic  criminal hysteria, armed and very dangerous....",1
"""How the hell can people move here in 2013, be on the forefront of legalization in Oregon with a felony, not even FROM OREGON...""

You must not live within 50 miles Portland because I nearly 2/3 of the people I talk to came from somewhere outside the NW.",1
"This is what a serious mental illness looks like, these paramilitaries/militias/”sovereign citizens”, a sociopathic paranoic delusional criminal hysteria, contagious to a degree, armed and very dangerous.",1
"""Real freedom""? Freedom to kill wantonly when YOU decide you're in the right? This is why we have laws; both Federal and State; to control the likes of these assholes. They should all be rounded up and imprisoned, all their property taken away to be sold to pay for this travesty they call an, ""occupation"". Pure scum, not patriots.",1
"Is there evidence that it was a Bernie supporter? Last time I checked, Trump supporters poop too.",1
I honestly cannot decide if these guys are complete morons or the most patriotic hero's this country has seen in a long time.,1
There will always be idiots doing something stupid.  Wash the car and get over it there are many more important things to do and think about.  I hope your 'desire to detach and decompress' works out for you.  Cheers and best wishes.,1
"They are a bunch of millionaire wannabe agribusiness failures with too much time to spend on the internet listening to others tell them they are God's chosen. Just another crop of morons getting their just reward, and it ain't  gonna be in heaven",1
Where do you get the Sour Grapes to say this is a Bernie person?  Based on how Bernie does not allow this crap to go on where do you get off with the accusation?,1
"Love it!  Alas, though, there are no fun non-derogatory nouns for the male equivalent of tomboy.  My son's choices will be relegated to ""sissy""/""mama's boy"" or ""variant""/""nonconforming"".   Yes, he's a ""boy"" and ""human"" -- but as you noted, the power of self-identification as something cool and different can be magical.",1
They are terrorists pure and simple.,1
"Dear world:
Just a reminder that none of these folks actually live in Oregon.  Please remember that when you decide to paint our state as a bunch of wackos! 

Sincerely,
Oregon",1
"Considering the real facts of this issue, I believe that it was inappropriate for the informant to report this ""scandal"" to the media. In my opinion, the informant most likely has a personal vendetta with individuals in the school. Or it is a common case of parental gossip. (Definition of gossip: casual or unconstrained conversation or reports about other people, typically involving details that are not confirmed as being true). If the freshman were dangerous to the community, he would have been removed from the school permanently. Though it was a stupid decision to create a ""hit list,"" one must take into account that teenagers react to hormones in different ways.",1
"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don’t allow them to use the loo; they’re doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I’m an illiberal jerk, I’ll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

P.S.  Would you prefer a locked gate or armed guards?",1
"After watching that video, it is lucky more people weren't killed.  Finicum was going for his gun, besides he wasn't at all complying with Law Enforcement. In many ways it appears he was trying to distract Law Enforcement.   It is sort of like watching an idiot being shot after trying avoid a major police stop with guns drawn.",1
I advise the Feds to follow the money that is given to these anti American religious sovereign terrorists.,1
"You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us.

Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",1
"This is just freaking sad. Another great place lost to greedy developers building more huge apartments in an already crowded area. So long Portland, you are becoming the worst city ever.",1
Mmmmm you had me at cheap and mediocre.,1
I've gone there for 30 years and was born and raised in Portland. I would love to know how many people that have an opinion on this really speak for the Real Oregonians. Because we wouldn't have a housing problem if you all moved back where you came from. You've left some trashy city and brought your problems with you.,1
"Just did my first peer-review... it can be difficult because no context is provided, is there? What if the comment is, ""I completely agree!""? Now, not particularly great content, but certainly sounds civil. But what if that comment is in reply to someone calling someone else, ""you are a puss-filled jerkwad that should be forced to receive many awkward hugs from Ted Cruz!"". It wouldn't be civil to ""completely agree"" to that nasty note, and yet I just gave it a big thumbs up!",1
What if his opinion is that most other commenters are idiots? :-),1
"It took forever to log in. And I am doubtful if it will work the next time. Personally I was not bothered by the ignorant, vile, nasty comments. I just thought it showed the stupidity of the posters. I suppose it scared away some timid souls, to be reviled for being a feminazi or a liberal posting agit-prop. 
I worry, since Eugene is a liberal town, that conservative comments, no matter how civil, will be voted down. And what is this algorith? Is it like Carnivore, looking for nasty words like the fword, mf, etc?",1
LTD needs to be neutered.,1
"The issue of the 19 - 16 year old is, who's the aggressor and why? The 19 yo is college age, the girl a junior  (?) in high school. True love or nailing a virgin (maybe)? With teenage sex, the girl takes home the puppy.
As to did the old guy commit crimes? He denies it - of course. I imagine there's more evidence than an accusation.",1
I do love Yataimura Maru's ramen.   It is a perfect food for Portland's long winter.   And PDX does kick a little ass.,1
Anyone who knows Alex will find this ridiculous. I wonder why this people are not telling the truth and why they can’t come even close to being as politically active. This guy's posters and art are the most amazing thing that happened to Portland. Too bad that you are just very fake faux anarchists.,1
"I guess I would say that you, as a man, haven't had to deal with systematic oppression based on your gender and that you are part of the dominant group and therefore have the luxury of thinking that gender doesn't play a role in anything. And thank you for telling me who I want to vote for! I won't say it was your testicles that helped you do it, but I don't think they hurt in this situation either.",1
"These parents are a bunch of pussy ass crybabies. As a Lincoln student I personally know that approxametilie 80% of he school is white. Pat Adelman had every right to get mad at the players for being racist themselves.  The parents are to blame, as they need to pull the stick out of their ass",1
