"Ryan Bundy seems like a nice, responsible  human being who has been sold a bill of goods by his  intellectually domineering brother, who he idolizes. Ammon has a bunch of other similarly situated nutters following him as well.  Where? No one quite knows. And, unless you live in Burns no one cares. Personally, I am glad these bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated , nuisances....are there and not here. Traffic is bad enough.  No reason to make it worse with a Constitutional Pagent Play in the Federal Building in downtown PDX.  And,  repulsive as their  cammo costumes are ( all available at Cabela's and Andy and Bax) with their brandishing weapons it's a very immature male form of exhibitionism....cowboys and indians for middle aged men.",0

"Richard Ellmyer, check out Agent Bretzing's official bio at the Portland FBI page -- turns out he went to Brigham Young U, leading me to believe that he has things in common with the Bundy boys.

Also, for the first action taken against the terrorists at the scene we can thank the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, who have a video at https://www.facebook.com/backcountryhabitat/videos/980875531985426/?theater    
showing their guys ripping down the BS militia sign and restoring the Wildlife Refuge sign.  They also have a petition to show support for keeping our public land publicly owned & managed.",0
"Haven't been to Tastebud's new location, but good on them for throwing a bone (crust?) to SW. Their pizza game is strong. SE Portland is fully saturated in great pizza, though I'm sad Pizza Maria closed. It was fantastic. But here's what I wonder: with all of this genuinely great pizza to be had on and around SE Division (I'd go to P.R.E.A.M. or Apizza Scholls every day if I could, and Cibo is excellent, as is Roman Candle, though a completely different style), how do places like Atlas Pizza survive? Atlas Pizza should not still exist by all the laws of gods and men, and yet. AND YET. Anyway üçïüçïüçï",0
That's good to hear! Does anyone have links to the work he was honored for? Or was it just for general performance? I'd love to explore it.,0
"Good question, Jackie! How do these yokels make their money? Well, LaVoy Finicum just had his foster children taken from his ranch, likely as a result of him becoming a militant criminal likely to face a suite of federal felony charges. Some reports and tax filings from his home state suggest Finicum was receiving, some years, $100,000 from Catholic Charities to provide foster care. While - according to his statements to the media - his cows barely pay for ranch expenses, the money from the kids could presumably pay for his lifestyle (surely other state money also helped). Was he getting free labor from boys who could work with him on his ranch? Perhaps, but all we know is that with the loss of his foster kids, Finicum is sad to be losing his monetary income, and says he may have to go back to eating rice and beans now that he's not getting paid thousands a week to house, feed, and provide ample ranch work for foster kids.",0
"I just want to say that rents need to get back to reality. People should spend no more than 31% income for housing. For me that makes sense, no more than one third of what you make for housing, then you have money for savings and for enjoying life! 
And... about Hart Noecker, if I see him anywhere I will Noecker in the snout.",0

"Climate justice activists have repeatedly told Novick that they will support density proposals if adequate protections exist for the working class and the poor, otherwise we'll just build a wonderful green city that only the rich can afford to live in. He keeps getting stuck on this point like a broken record without actually listening to what people are repeatedly communicating to him. 

Solid electoral strategy.",0
"Gosh, what happened to Novick?  He seems to have lost some intellectual acuity.  Now he is a close-minded pro-density anti-car fetishist.

It's dumb to deny climate science, but the importance of stacking everyone in apartments can be debated.   The biggest contributors to global warming are agriculture, sheep and dirty utility plants.  In fact, there are studies suggesting that a big dog has a big carbon footprint, but you wouldn't hear Novisk risk angering dogowners.

BTW- I note that the most strident anti-car types still fly, and that we have tech bros working in the Bay Area and living part time here.  Let's have a discussion of what jets do to the environment- but that would be shared sacrifice.

I am voting for that Emmons guy.  He seems okay and Novick is the pits.",0
"I'm sorry to hear this Carl. I thought you and Thom were thick as thieves. And I can't imagine what he could have said or done for you to lump him in with the more beligerant Bernie fans. I mean, after all, he doesn't allow folks to badmouth Hillary on his show, and daily....maybe even hourly....states emphatically that he will support her if she gets the nod in the primaries, and work hard to get her elected.

But politics is your passion, man....take some time off, if you need, and come back, ok?",0
"Predatory patrol towing isn't a big subject, and there is no advocacy group that is paying any attention to it, but the City of Portland has completely backed off of enforcing state law where the towing predators are operating on private property, and this is Commissioner Novick's failure. He's in charge of towing.

The City has allowed Retriever Towing to operate in open violation of ADA for years at their NW Quimby lot, and there is absolutely no provision in city ordinance that takes into account when they tow a mobility-disabled person's vehicle.  Wheelchair or no wheelchair, the person has to get themselves to the tow yard (which does not have wheelchair access).

Led by Senator Avel Gordly, the legislature enacted important new citizen protections against predatory towing effective January 1, 2008, but there is no effective way for Portlanders to learn what their rights are other than what the predatory towers themselves tell you. A description of the protections has never appeared on the City website. The version posted there has never been correct.

It is only in the past two years the the City began enforcing the signage requirements, and the City Towing Coordinator worked with the towers to pass the costs onto the citizens. $ 20 of every tow bill goes to the towers to ""compensate"" them for their signs, with no upper limit, and your $ 20 is likely to be paying for signs completely unrelated to the place your vehicle was towed from.

Portland towers are allowed to operate in open violation of state law and the City's own statutes, providing towing services to property owners for free. That is specifically prohibited by state law and City ordinance.

Senator Gordly's legislation was intended to protect people living in apartment complexes, generally low-income, minority populations, and they have no one standing up for them in City Hall. I hope you are that champion.",0
The show had both sponsors and listeners. No need to denigrate the man's show.,0
"I sure do hope Carl changes his mind. He's a great radio talk show host. I always liked him and Thom in the mornings on KPOJ. And Heidi, miss her alot, and the rare commitment to our liberal progressive values they displsyed during the darkest days of the Bush years. I adnire hiw Thom relished the opportunity to mix it up with total right wingers. But he has a certain kind of reserve to stay on purpose and let the stupidity roll off like water off a duck's back. Carl has a great big huge heart, and he cares too much, takes it all in and si its part of who he is as a human being I would venture a guess.",0
"Um. Bernie supporters attack.  Thom Hartmann a liar.

Definitely time to step away from the mike.  Lousy timing, but there you are.
Politics is personal. Always has been. Always will be. It's neither for the faint of heart nor the intrinsically correct.  It's an election.  Put on your big boy underpants and stand up.",0
"I agree with the supportive comments to this story.  This teacher is enthusiastic and engages her students. The map allowed them to learn major geographic features of Africa in a fun, creative way - a perfect assignment for an arts focus school. My child is thriving at Da Vinci, which allows him to learn in a way that suits his artistic and musical interests. I would add that the student body is more diverse than our neighborhood school, in terms of ethnicity and economics.",0
"Sad to hear Carl is giving it up.  

More the shame that Thom Hartmann has not taken a similar path and relieved the airwaves of his vitriol and misinformation.",0
This story is a non-story! My son has had this teacher for 3 years and I wish he had her for the rest of his scholastic career. This project is par for the course for the teacher because it's creative and has students thinking about culture different ways to learn a subject.,0
"I was impressed with Nicholas' comment but regret that he sounds defensive. Steve, you are missing the point that government's role is to mitigate the displacement effects of gentrification, granted, caused by population and economic pressures from outside the city, so that we can all benefit from increased density, not become disaffected, rootless citizens of our home town.",0
"My son is a 7th Grader at Da Vinci and I am also in support of the school, the principal, teachers and staff and especially the energetic, funny and supportive teacher that you are blatantly disrespecting in this article. Her comments in the email were intended as humor, which anyone with a sense of humor would know, and I can only hope the person who ""tipped"" off WW of this ""news-breaking"" story could gain a sense of their own. This is ""news""?! It has to be challenging enough as teachers to cut through the modern distractions to teach our children of today, especially with such varied and rabid opinions of parents (myself included). Do we also have to attack and harp on their attempts to energize and engage kids in fun, funny and interesting ways? Parents who would get so upset over a class project may want to consider home-schooling. We can't control all aspects of our children's education. This article is unnecessary. You should write an apology to this thoughtful teacher.",0
"Boy, if Carl can't handle Bernie Sanders supporters there's no hope for him against Trump supporters. Better to get while the gettin's good.",0
"I'm not a conservative, but I am ashamed to be an Oregon taxpayer supporting this nonsense.  Conservatives have it right this time - this is about so-called ""white privilege"", white guilt, white shaming.  It's divisive and insensitive and takes advantage of a double standard that makes it okay to say ""angry white men"" but screams racism if you say ""angry black men.""  No matter what kind of spin PCC tries to put on this one, it's still ugly and offensive.",0
"Why does everything have to be about destruction, man? Like, building is a beautiful thing, you know? Man.",0
"Author of article here. I appreciate this fact-check, but 1977 can't be right, because John Williams was born in 1977: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B

How could he have composed the music if he wasn't born yet? At age 5 or 6 though, it would definitely be possible (look at Mozart, for example).",0

Wesley Crusher, the cause of all ills across multiple galaxies.",0
I'm still baffled by how his role made it to any draft of the Phantom Menace script...,0
Star Trek Original Series had excellent writing. Star Trek Next Generation had Sir Patrick Stewart. Star Wars had Alec Guiness and killed him off in the first episode! STOS>STNG>SW!,0
I think their much the same. I don't loose any love for Jar Jar Bink's but I don't know if it would of been the same movie without him. The Tribbles are much better than the Ewoks to. üêµ,0
I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler but Jam Jar Banks is my favorite character because he exists in both Stars War and Trek.,0
"I am going to say that his arguments have no merit whatsoever and are a good test for this system since he seems to be trolling the system. I didn't read the article I stopped at ""Don't get me wrong, I've never seen Star Trek"". If he can't watch any Star Trek to make his argument, I am not about to read his thoughts on the issue. That doesn't mean I don't want to check out this comment system.",0
"Really? This article is actually news? My daughter was lucky to lottery into da Vinci. Her cake turned out damn good, confetti cake from a box with the best pillsbury white frosting, candy corn mountains, brown sugar desert, and a bunch of other sugar filled non organic deliciousness. And can you believe this.. She had fun! Omg! Creativity! How terrible. 

Art school is hard folks. Want your kid to go to an art school, do the lottery like everyone else. Just because my daughter goes to da Vinci doesn't mean my son will. He will have to lottery too with no sibling priority in his favor. Oh no... Maybe he'll end up at Hosford! How will we survive the nonelitest school??? We will manage, thanks.",0
"I know of a guy that got an $800,000 grant for his high tech fuels business and he blatantly brags about how he was able to use it for personal use with no follow up or repayment required. He went out and bought himself rental properties and a new Audi. I can only hope there is some back track follow up by the city and prosecute some of these scammers. Looks like this story could be the tip of a big iceberg of widespread misappropriation of city funds.",0
"I feel for him, and I feel the exact same way just with the abuse I've suffered from people on social media who are Sanders' supporters.  It's a shame really.  As a life-long democrat, from where I sit, they've done nothing but emulate the Republican party by causing such a nasty division, which in the end, hurts us all.  They are the kind of people who make me think about voting 3rd party should he win the nomination.",0
"Best? Remains the king? Sounds like the reviewer got a deal for Appiza for a year. There are too many pizza joints giving it their all to offer a top product and some little writer hands the free publicity crown to one joint. Appiza does have good pizza like many others, a lot of Portlanders are not that crazy about charred pizza like Appiza serves. Spangler even admits he got into the pizza biz because of the high profit margins over being a bakery serving individual loaves of bread. That is why they are so strict/rude about substitutions on their precious pies and those cheap bulk purchased ice cream sandwiches for dessert, profit baby. ""One of the best in my opinion"" comment would certainly give more credibility to the reviewer.",0
"I had no idea such vitriol was happening. But I usually stay away from the comments sections because of the harshness and trolls (perhaps they‚Äôre really SQUIRRELS!) that predominate.

I am an avid Bernie supporter, am an not a fan of Hilary, but of course would vote for any Democrat against the alternative. I have gotten a little heartburn when Carl says he‚Äôs unelectable, but I recognize it‚Äôs a real concern, and the stakes could not be higher with actual fascist candidates from the Republic side within striking distance of the Presidency.

I hope Carl reconsiders. He‚Äôs the very best radio host I‚Äôve ever heard - in any of the markets I‚Äôve been in, including LA. He is warm, inviting, wide-ranging, thoughtful, compassionate, and FUNNY! He was the SOLE reason I just donated to XRAY FM, so that‚Äôs a bummer. Carl - why don‚Äôt you just stop reading social media? Or, as it is usually expressed, anti-social media?

We need you Carl. Especially this year. Much love to you, regardless.",0
So this guy wants better nutrition but also wants to poison everybody with the neurotoxin fluoride. I'm afraid he has no credibility  if  it's true.,0
"I worry that pursuing density in the current market may be condemning us to repeat the same eco-apartheid we're already seeing--that's worsening--in inner Portland neighborhoods where sustainable, walkable, green neighborhoods are available exclusively to wealthier residents who can afford it. 

From Rachel: ""Could you tell me what you think of that criticism from him -- that the local environmentalists aren't mobilizing on what's an important issue that would actually have an important impact locally?""

Me:
""I don't think that there is a consensus among local environmental groups about exactly how we should be increasing density. A lot of these neighbors who are dominating the comp plan hearings are complaining about the loss of mature trees, solar access, and the general character of their neighborhoods. I think a lot of environmentalists see density development driven by a market frenzy as sometimes inherently in contradiction with some environmental values. <continued>",0
"No, he wants to increase the health of our children's teeth.",0
"Can we save everyone some time and money and just declare her the winner now?   I mean Novick has done everything possible to alienate the voters in this town.  I have not been impressed with much, if anything, he has done for the city.  ""Hey, here's a new street tax idea that totally hammers the residents and basically leave out the trucking industry"" in three different forms.    No thanks to Steve.   
Looking forward to hearing what Sue has to offer.",0
And Bernie supporters here prove his point right on cue.,0
"It's tough to lose Carl Wolfson's show yet again!   Out here in the wilderness of Clackamas County, his show has been a bright spot for insightful commentary and humor.  He's a very gifted radio host and fine human being.  I can't imagine how tough it is to toil away with no salary--dependent totally upon community support to keep going.
I understand the need to step away from politics, though and wish him the best.",0
"I rather like Bernie I'm truly undecided on which progressive candidate I will vote for. I hate the vitriol of Sanders supporters. They need to wake up. I like Bernie's message, but I'm afraid of the voters who say they will NEVER vote for Hillary. Personally, I will be voting for the woman or man who gets the nomination, whoever it will be. I really hope Bernie AND Hillary supporters will come to their senses.",0
"Love it!  Alas, though, there are no fun non-derogatory nouns for the male equivalent of tomboy.  My son's choices will be relegated to ""sissy""/""mama's boy"" or ""variant""/""nonconforming"".   Yes, he's a ""boy"" and ""human"" -- but as you noted, the power of self-identification as something cool and different can be magical.",1
"Considering the real facts of this issue, I believe that it was inappropriate for the informant to report this ""scandal"" to the media. In my opinion, the informant most likely has a personal vendetta with individuals in the school. Or it is a common case of parental gossip. (Definition of gossip: casual or unconstrained conversation or reports about other people, typically involving details that are not confirmed as being true). If the freshman were dangerous to the community, he would have been removed from the school permanently. Though it was a stupid decision to create a ""hit list,"" one must take into account that teenagers react to hormones in different ways.",1
"Part 3
The owner of Remedy Wine Bar (which closes in days) asked people why they sh*t in his doorway when there is a Public Loo nearby.  Answer: Drug Dealers don‚Äôt allow them to use the loo; they‚Äôre doing business. 

Allowing that segment of the squatters who suffer (a) from mental illness or (b) addiction to rot outside is not an act of compassion.  If the Police may not engage, then they cannot triage.  YOU and Mayor Hales are, literally, killing them with your kindness. 

If you think I‚Äôm an illiberal jerk, I‚Äôll tell that I gave a year of my life (unpaid) to the Democratic Party in an effort to make Oregon a one-party state.  

Now, it is time for Democrats to evolve.

P.S.  Would you prefer a locked gate or armed guards?",1
"After watching that video, it is lucky more people weren't killed.  Finicum was going for his gun, besides he wasn't at all complying with Law Enforcement. In many ways it appears he was trying to distract Law Enforcement.   It is sort of like watching an idiot being shot after trying avoid a major police stop with guns drawn.",1
"You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us.

Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",1
What if his opinion is that most other commenters are idiots? :-),1
"The issue of the 19 - 16 year old is, who's the aggressor and why? The 19 yo is college age, the girl a junior  (?) in high school. True love or nailing a virgin (maybe)? With teenage sex, the girl takes home the puppy.
As to did the old guy commit crimes? He denies it - of course. I imagine there's more evidence than an accusation.",1
"I guess I would say that you, as a man, haven't had to deal with systematic oppression based on your gender and that you are part of the dominant group and therefore have the luxury of thinking that gender doesn't play a role in anything. And thank you for telling me who I want to vote for! I won't say it was your testicles that helped you do it, but I don't think they hurt in this situation either.",1
"These parents are a bunch of pussy ass crybabies. As a Lincoln student I personally know that approxametilie 80% of he school is white. Pat Adelman had every right to get mad at the players for being racist themselves.  The parents are to blame, as they need to pull the stick out of their ass",1
"Yeah, that man would look pretty ridiculous, given that 80% of congress, 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs, and 100% of American presidents are male. Why, do you suppose, do those women make an issue of that?",1
"So because LE tactics are ""extreme"" in your words, they are responsible for their own death? That is the most ignorant comment I have ever heard. LE personnel don't know what they get into day in and day out.  They don't know whether or not the girl who is trying to report her husband beat her up is waiting behind the door to shoot the officer in an ambush. What about the transient that he or she gives money too instead of taking them to jail?  Why don't you go spend a shift in a patrol car with an officer and see what he actually does on a daily basis? Instead you sit behind your computer and criticize their ""tactics.""",1
Just a note--even most conservatives and gun owners thought Bundy was a nutjob. Even his nutjob father thought he was a nutjob. That's nutjob squared.,1
"Residence in our local county hoosegow will be quite educational for Bundy and his troops.  There, they will meet lots of interesting people.  We got black gangstas, and brown gangstas, methheads and assorted other felons.",1
"ScienceDuck:  You're seeking ""civil conversation"" on this site....oh, wait a minute, that's the name of the site, isn't it.  C.J.101's position is really rather simple....civil? well no, but certainly simple.  If you disagree with him, it's because you're a)ignorant (don't have the facts) or b) stupid (couldn't understand those facts if you had them) or c) both of the above.  Discussion, coversation and debate are all worthwhile pursuits.  Dismissing those who oppose your position as ignorant, as does CJ101, contributes nothing and, instead, inhibits such civil discourse.",1
"garycrum is a regular in this forum, spewing his typical lies, arrogance, and hypocrisy, all of which is uncivil and not conducive to an adult conversation ... you call it toxic verbal sludge, and that's good, although I've always called it transcribed flatulence.",1

"its not the camping, its the mounds of garbage. I don't care if people sleep in tents but the kinds of campers all along waterfront and out on the trail are the very worst offenders and clearly didn't get the pack in pack out message. that's what the city seems to be tolerating. giant shit heaps along otherwise pretty corridors. if the city is going to allow camping it better give its garbage men a raise!!!",1
"In his letter, Cook also makes the entirely correct point that even if Apple creates the backdoor the government wants, bad actors will simply begin using other encryption software that is readily available to them, some of which is made by foreign companies who our government cannot coerce into providing a back door. This will compromise the security of 1 billion Apple devices now being used around the world, thus putting Apple's customers at risk and putting Apple at a serious competitive disadvantage to foreign companies who do not have to comply with our government. All for the unlikely possibility that the one phone Farook did not destroy will fill in 18 missing minutes. This is a foolish knee-jerk reaction from a technologically clueless judge.",1
"Every government is prone to tyranny unless those who are governed are diligently watchful over those who are given great power and are supposed to be serving them. This law subverts our ability to be watchful.

Conflating the civil disobedience of a group who has to date never hurt or killed anyone with radical Muslim extremists is nonsense, and most certainly not the same thing. Would you have withheld Officer Darren Wilson's name from the violent and misinformed rioters in Ferguson? Quite frankly, he was in far more danger. The principles involved are of such importance that releasing the name is imperative.

While police officers don't specifically sign up to be put in unduly dangerous positions, they know danger is part of the job. I prefer to use readily available methods of protecting them that do not carry the ongoing risk of abuse inherent in codifying a lack of accountability of our police into law. Think how such a law would go over in black neighborhoods.",1

"Who:  I certainly didn't say ""all Christians"" were operating Ponzi schemes either.  I am  not a member of Mr. Shockley's church (or any church), but I do know he was very involved and active in that church.  You note that ""someone of such low character was passing themselves off as a Christian.""  You think that's bad.  Based on your assertions (unsupported, by the way) it seems that, even worse, ""someone of such low character was (also) passing themselves off as a Democrat.""  These damn lowlifes; they're giving both the Christian Church and the Democatic Party a bad name.  Whatever shall we do?",1

Sanders IS ""old"". He IS ""angry"". He's not ""cleaned up"" by image makers. He is the real deal. If we have to have youth and good looks, I would also ask, what makes such qualifications relevant to the presidency?",1

"WTF Schor & Sponberg?

Get real- Levoy Finnicum was a fundy Mormon terrorist who is now considered a martyr by a movement characterized by extreme racism (Aaron Campbell was marked by Cain and can never enter Heaven). 

Some nut job can and will try and kill the officer and his or her family.  Remember  that Bundy supporters threatened women, children and clergy at their homes in Harney County.

Both Schor and Sponberg are advocating a position that has a great chance of ending in murder of an Oregon law enforcement officer (or two).   They are accidentally siding with Bundy supporters on this one.

As always, Wheeler is the only sane person in the room.
Portland cops shooting civilians will still be identified.  But what is chilling is Schor's and Sponberg's willingness to let some idiot from Arizona show up at a deputies house and kill him.  That is a real problem folks, because the Bundys are actual terrorists. And Schor and Sponbergs are idiots.",1
"That's what President Teddy Roosevelt used to call ""The White Man's Burden"" and evangelical churches continue to do to this day.  To leave Oregon and go over to educate the poor and ignorant of the world so that our values become theirs because they are unable to take care of themselves.",1
"Wilkens turns his head back and to the left at 3:31, then gives a ""darn!"" shake of his head, then stops.",1
"Jules is the candidate who attends an anti-gay, misogynist church.  I suspect the PAT didn't know that when they endorsed him.   Now they are in a bad position- piss off the possible mayor and hurt the union, or offend all the groups
that Bailey's church condemns as sinners.   I like PAT and I wish they hadn't endorsed a man who is deep down inside, probably a bigot.  Because he chose that bigot church out of all the churches in Portland.",1
"Affirmative action to match the US population?   C'mon Man!  It's gonna really be hard to find that many non-blacks (other than  some Samoans) who won't get squashed flat on their first 1st down or slammed over the top by that 6'8"" black forward!  You're talking like a crazy man!",1
"Jules Bailey would have us overlook his church's discriminatory policies simply because he says he disagrees with them.  And anyway, ""we're family"", as if it's just his crazy Uncle Imago Dei in the attic.

Mr. Baily's religion is his private business.  Nonetheless, as a candidate ""running to be a mayor for everybody"", the organizations he chooses to join are a very valid indicator of his beliefs and values.  (Jules, there are hundreds of churches which do not deny civil rights to the LBGT community.  Did you even look?)

Portlanders care deeply when a mayoral candidate chooses to join an organization which denies civil rights to any group.  What if Mr. Bailey chose to join an organization which denied civil rights to blacks?  Women? Moslems? 

As they say, Mr. Bailey, ""you can choose your friends but you can't choose your family."" In this case, you have chosen to affiliate yourself with ""family"" which denies the LBGT community full civil rights. Portland voters will not overlook this.",1
"The point is: Imago Dei has doctrines that are repugnant to me and other Portlanders.  We hear the all-male ""Elders"" arguing for 1. female submission 2. unmarried households are living in sin 3. gay sex is sin.

This is not a flawed doctrine- it is a homophobic misogynist doctrine that your evangelical church wants to spread.  You are no different from a Santorum supporter except that the Santorum supporter is more honest and will not deny their church's doctrine.",1
"another biased, hate-filled, loud, bombastic, angry  german man with funny hair - the last one turned out so well...
+++has any thought been given to how trump would divest himself of financial interests should be become president?  what dark paths will his financial power be hidden?",1
"Sure, Wheeler visits the house of the milktoast christians on Sunday, but he worships at the tit of corporate profit the rest of the week. 

Are we really going to ignore their policy and base the election on their level of sky-god delusion? As far as that goes, they both seem like cafeteria christians to me.",1
"Wheeler and Bailey go to vastly different cafeterias.

Jules bailey worships at the same denomination as Falwell/Huckabee/Franklin Graham/Ted Cruz.  His church preaches female submission and that gays are sinful.  He titthes to this church and also does Bible study with them.Even if his conservative fundy evangelical church pretends to be cool- they are the same homophobes as you would find at Liberty University.   
Wheeler goes to a more inclusive church, and his sky god is not as scary.

Wheeler and Bailey have some similar policies, but I find Bailey untrustworthy & wishy-washy.  Note that he won't defend the church but still gives it $.  What does Bailey believe and what will he stand up for?  Why does he listen to a Pastor who preaches that Jessica Bailey should submit to Jules Bailey?

I can understand voting for David Schor- but Bailey? Bailey? What a weakling.",1
Fuck this guy flag his post,1
so where s your proof? its easy for shit talkers like you to acuse when hes not here to defend himself. id like to take a peek into your closet jim.,1
"Gee, nice straw man.  I don't ""dehumanize"" Bailey- I say he is a bad choice for Mayor.
He hangs with- drum roll please- homophobes.  That makes me someone who doesn't like bigots.  His friends aren't acceptable because they have really, really dumb ideas that they evangelize.",1
"Now why would you want to muddy the shark-infested liberal water with actual quotes, facts and common sense?  Can't you see this witch hunt for what it is?  It's much easier to hate the Donald without them.  What??? Trump ""knew"" who David Duke was???  Hang him!!!",1
Reagan would definitely be shaking in his boots hearing and seeing all of these boorish comments coming from grown men...oops did I say grown men?  More like silly boys in the school yard......,1
"No potty mouthing in the editorial DR. But potty mouthing is now front and center for the GOP ""elite"". For example, Rubio's reference to Trump's lack of anatomical size and leaky plumbing. Embarrassment and shame on him. What's next, spitting?",1
"Sadly, areas near low cost apartments just seem to naturally attract a lower class of people, who also tend to be more involved in crime.  

We have had a couple of bad cases of vandalism on my block in recent years.   And each time, it was traced to teens living in low cost apartments a few blocks away.    I'm sure that most of the folks living in the apartments are good and decent folk.  But there is always going to be a bad element in the mix.

My next door neighbor parks his cars outside, and in the last incident, the kid spray painted: ""< N word>  LOVER"" in big letters across his vehicle.   It sure upset my neighbor a lot.  These are just extremely low class and immoral people, who seem to be both very bored and very stupid.",1
"Tongue firmly in cheek.  How did he manage to pass the background check to acquire his handgun??  Surely several more gun laws would have prevented this shooting.

Seriously though, this is the kind of criminal the murdered Sgt. Gooding in Seaside.  The liberals in Salem can try to goody two shoes these animals all they want.  Shorter sentences and probation are not the answer.  This idiot will end up killing someone if he doesn't get killed by the cops first.",1
Who cares. He's such an untalented egotistical idiot.,1
"Yahoo!!!  Finally someone calling this old fool to account.  I have had the distinct displeasure of having this man as my senator for more years than I care to count, and I hope Matt succeeds.  Courtney is totally out of touch with those in his district, and continues to pursue his braindead liberal policies as he is reelected time and again by the same braindead constituents.  He has been in the senate far too long and is long overdue to move on.  Send me a petition, Matt!  I'll sign it, gladly.",1
"So, Ms. Ricci, you weren't ""embarrassed"" by W's two ridiculous and costly wars, Katrina, his melting down of the economy?

"Diverse? Sure Trump is the ""epitome of diversity"". No one is immune to his ""diverse"", daily discharges of hate, race baiting, misogyny, and brazen serial lying, ""...Mexicans are rapists..."". A pathetic windbag who tramples (trumples?) civility and compassion with obscene, disgusting comments. He'll go down hard and blame it on someone else.",1
"Uh, no. It's the hate-filled conservative core that has finally found a guy who stands up and says it, loud and proud: I'm a bigot!
What's amazing is the continuing support among the conservative poor for the repeal of Obamacare. Many of them and their families are profiting from it and yet, like higher taxes on the rich or a higher minimum wage, they oppose it.
This incredible stupidity on their part has been going on for years. It's like watching the village idiot hit himself in the head, repeatedly, and complain of a headache.",1
To all of you people that say he's impeding the flow of traffic or what happened to the there's 5 vehicles behind you you must yield the right-of-way. Do you see those fluorescent triangles it means slow moving  vehicle and do you see the four horses pulling that wagon in the state of Oregon those four horses have the right of way on any roadway. Remember just because your car can do 110 miles an hour you don't have to be an asshole,1
