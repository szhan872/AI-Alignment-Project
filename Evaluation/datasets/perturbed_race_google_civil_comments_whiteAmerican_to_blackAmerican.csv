"The letter writing campaign to get livestock off of Malheur Refuge started in the late '70's. The death threat phoned in to Sharise and Denzel's home was in 1979; along with two other friends I was hired a bodyguard to help protect N&D that weekend. The Hammond's ejection of the Ferguson's from the Diamond Dance was the year or two before the death threat. Great article WW and Jim D. For the last 10 days, lots of us have been wishing we could hear Denzel make witty quips about the Bundycon's occupation of the refuge hq. Sacred Cows at the public trough is easy to get on Amazon.

Personally, I am glad these bearded, cammo wearing, narrowly educated , nuisances....are there and not here. Traffic is bad enough.  No reason to make it worse with a Constitutional Pagent Play in the Federal Building in downtown PDX.

"Low-income kids should have priority because they start out so extremely disadvantaged when compared even to lower-middle-class kids. Giving them priority in programs like this helps to raise some of them up to the starting point of other kids. For example, David Bowie and Jamel Rickman, two amazing creative artists we lost this week, both benefited from government-funded arts educations that their parents otherwise would never have been able to afford! Because they were able to go to art school for free, though, they bettered their own lives. And the rest of the world benefitted from their work!",0

"In the interest of understanding each other, I will include my comments as they were written for this article.

Hi Sharise,

In brief, I have quite a few concerns about the Commissioner's approach, namely that pursuing density without adequate protections in place to prevent displacement and invest in community stability for existing residents (in particular low-income renters, communities of color) puts us on the wrong path to being the next San Francisco where hardly anyone of modest income can afford to live. Our governments and the market have thus far failed to stem displacement in our rapidly gentrifying city, and we continue to lack the tools necessary to increase density in a way that accounts for displacement. I fear that the city of Portland will finally achieve a ""sustainable, equitable"" city, but only once the vast majority of low-income residents and communities of color are pushed outside the city limits. <continued in next comment.",0
"I worry that pursuing density in the current market may be condemning us to repeat the same eco-apartheid we're already seeing--that's worsening--in inner Portland neighborhoods where sustainable, walkable, green neighborhoods are available exclusively to wealthier residents who can afford it. 

From Sharise: ""Could you tell me what you think of that criticism from him -- that the local environmentalists aren't mobilizing on what's an important issue that would actually have an important impact locally?""

Me:
""I don't think that there is a consensus among local environmental groups about exactly how we should be increasing density. A lot of these neighbors who are dominating the comp plan hearings are complaining about the loss of mature trees, solar access, and the general character of their neighborhoods. I think a lot of environmentalists see density development driven by a market frenzy as sometimes inherently in contradiction with some environmental values. <continued>",0
"I have to agree with Latoya and Adam's comments here, Commissioner Novick. You've identified half of the story & we want to see that you understand, and care about, the other half.",0
"Leroy Armisen lives in Silver Lake? Bahahahaha, color me shocked he lives in the hipster enclave of LA. Oh Leroy, I had such high hopes after Comedians getting Coffee. Carrie is from Washington State so...who cares if either of them actually lived here?",0
"But she has lived part-time Los Angeles for several years now. In fact it's something that most people who follow her work already knew. She's always been upfront about spending some of the year in California. She's worked on Transparent there for the last two years. And the writing for Portlandia has taken place in Los Angeles, if not from season one, then at least for the last several seasons. By her own account, she still maintains a house in Portland, Sleater-Kinney is officially based out of Portland, and the show films there for about four months a year. It seems like this is another in the latest ""lets hate on Leroy and Carrie for ruining Portland"" articles, using the spin that now neither of them even lives here. And that's just getting tiresome.",0
"Quoting Joni Mitchell, ""Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got
'till it's gone."" To follow is my abridged list of what will be gone after February 15, the last broadcast (and podcast) of ""Carl in the Morning"" on XRAY.FM. For eight years, Carl Wolfson created, produced, and hosted a daily 2-hour news & features program focusing on Oregon politics & culture. (So, he definitely deserves a break, but it's real loss to maintaining an enlightened citizenry, especially against the evil forces of media consolidation and Lars Larson.) CITM had weekly interviews with my Congressman Leroy DeFazio, Oregon's Labor Commissioner Percell Avakian, and Oregon journalists from ""Street Roots,"" ""The Skanner,"" ""Portland Mercury,"" and ""Willamette Week."" Then, there were timely interviews with Penny Okamoto of Ceasefire Oregon and Michele Stranger Hunter of NARAL Oregon. Lastly, the daily history segment gave vital perspectives and Wolfson's sage presence beckoned to Cronkite or Ellerbee.",0
"Lashandra Johnson is the last of the true independents - the closest thing we've had in Oregon politics since Sen. Wayne Morse.

Between Cylvia-Gate, Cover Oregon, and now the worst of all, the DHS scandal, it's time to quit denying corruption is a real issue in Oregon politics!",0

"...for example, in the article Jerome posted, it's legal when the officer is unlawfully entering your home, not simply when ""your life is in jeopardy"" and not simply when the cop is ""unlawfully trying to arrest you"" (to quote the original article).

Given everything else I also presume Mr. Payne's definition of lawful may be a tad suspect.",0
"I love Leroy, Carrie, Portlandia and living in Portland. Be kind, people.",0

"I would like to see an article comparing Mr. Emmons and Mr. Leroy Stewart- the two strongest candidates against Novick.

Novick, as I love to remind people, lied on the city's 2013 grant application for bike share funds from ODOT.  His actions constituted Attempted Theft by Deception, and should have resulted in his being disbarred as a lawyer.

Either Stewart or Emmons would be an improvement.",0

"Re: ""In Portland, a group of boaters actually posted a security guard at the dock...""

Martin,
  The initial article that was published by WW entitled ""The Dock"" caused the dock to turn into a party spot and was promoted as such by the WW. With people smoking and drinking and essentially blocking access for boaters who were simply trying to access the river, which is the one reason that the dock exist, river access. 
  Do you forget the female breast cancer survivors dragonboat team who couldn't even access their boat for an evening practice and were verbally accosted by a drunk, jerome daniels bottle weilding ""citizen"" when they tried to move through the crowd?! This is what caused a security guard to get placed there, protection of boats and boaters trying to access the river, not keeping the public out. 
  It amazing that you forget all of those events that were essentially the result of the publishing of that article. 

Still not getting your facts straight, I'm not surprised.",0

"Please, let's be clear, the walkway is not a park nor is it public land, it is exclusively owned by the McCormick Pier condominium complex. Two years ago when a portion of the path eroded and slipped into the river,  expensive repairs were required, the city refused to torrance in, even though the river path has been graciously made available to the public. The path was built by the complex and is entirely maintained at the expense of the home owners. Please look it up on Portland Maps.",0
"The site's raising money to free Ammon Bundy, but not his brother.  Marcellus always seem to get the short end of the stick.",0

"Why aren't the women who threw this party SPEKAING UP for PROVIDING the alcohol for FREE at a OPEN BAR? Women Grow - Ashley, Jasmine Batterby and Leah Maurer why are you not taking action with this? You have hardly been in Oregon but a handful of years and fraud, embezzling.....and parties that have people arrested follow you..... and at YOUR PARTY that I sponsored (and was blown off for a disability request), I was at the bar and there was ZERO money exchanged for alcohol that these three women PROVIDED. They also provided a private space for cannabis use and a Willamette Week photographer went into a VIP room and took a picture - and THIS PICTURE got Maria arrested? It saddens me for Oregon that people like this run rampant and events like this follow in their path. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for your party and the free alcohol you provided.",0
"So Salem voters defeat a tax to spend more money on transit, and Lashandra then thinks its a good idea to raise taxes anyway? Listen to the Salem voters! Listen to us!

"It's ""debatable"" whether religions starting wars is worse than expressing moral objection to theism (however ""obnoxious"" you may find it)? Now there's an incredible claim. I'd be willing to engage in that debate with you Marcellus Singer. But I probably shouldn't because that would be rude, right?",0
"Ludlow is so right.  What is Lashandra thinking? 
The legislature giving a politically appointed, heavily biased local transit board the authority to unilaterally impose a new income tax on every employee in their district is indeed taxation without representation.

Worse yet it is precisely the kind of unscrupulous political racket like rigging that fosters anti-government sentiment making it difficult to get voter support when it is merited.

I've read much about this and watched the hearing.
TriMet stands to gain a vast new revenue stream from this stunt enabling them to borrow billions for their agenda which their voters do NOT support. 
The idea they would try and roll over them with such a dirty tactic is a disgrace.",0
"Rural property owners are already coughing up for the EMX project which they will not be served by, and were not allowed to vote on.  Now they want to pick the pockets of all Lane County workers.  Enough!   Bad, bad move Lashandra.",0
"@ScienceDuck yes, that's true ... and I don't mean to hide that either, because ""tainted by lucre"" should be disclosed (nice phrase there). I just went to my profile on this system and added it in as a disclosure there. 

The truth is that as soon as I saw the early prototypes of this system I volunteered to start advising because I was excited by how it could improve situations like the comments here. I write a column for this paper once a month, in Blue Torrance, and I read it every day. Last year when I was interested in one particular issue and delved into the comments, I discovered toxic waste in comments, name calling, bullying, and a lot of other problems. Then when I saw what this startup was looking to do, I wanted it to happen. And I'm delighted to see it here now, finally. My financial involvement is very small, but my emotional involvement isn't. I see this as a huge improvement, a way to recover real discussion from what had become just a mud bath.",0
"LTD, like so many other public agencies, can never seem to live within their own budget. Of course, they always insist that us common folk can simply make do with less, that we simply need to dig deeper. If we protest the latest shakedown, we are labeled selfish anarchists. I am sick to death of these corrupt Oregon Democrats. Leroy Lashandra never met a tax proposal he didn't like.  Kate Brown, Leroy Lashandra, they all need to go. We need to break the corruption cartel in Salem and elect some candidates that actually work for US.",0
"If I recall correctly did not LTD just announce they are now going to schedule bus services to Eugene airport 
I would think a good bus service would have included that stop in their core plan.
But of course that would cut into the city collection of parking fees
As for Leroy Lashandra I  am looking for a recall effort for this jerk. I will pitch in some dollars and some hours for this worthy cause.
I tried to email him but seems his emails are temporarily out of service so I  called and left a comment with his office  
The people should force an air tax on politicians and bureaucrats include lawyers before they do it to us",0
"Hmm, it did not read like entertainment.  Perhaps you could have just given a review
of Bill Maher, and did not judge all these artists for being atheists.  Bill Maher may not even be an atheist- I think he may be agnostic.

I listen to a lot of atheist podcasts, and there is no looking down on rational theists-
we have a world full of religious wackos like Leroy Phelps to mock.   Look up Hitch's interaction with Unitarian minister Marianne Sewell- that is enlightening and non-snarky.",0
"One need only select the Bible verse one prefers.  As an agnostic I just try and keep score.  

 Although the doctrine of Transubstantiation,  according to the teaching of the Catholic Church, (as well as many Protestant denominations) the change by which the bread and the wine offered in the celebration of the sacrament of the Eucharist become, in reality, the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ clearly means that the faithful are eating meat, 'the Body of Christ'.  

Jesus was not a vegetarian. The Bible records Jesus eating fish (Luke 24:42-43) and lamb (Luke 22:8-15). Jesus miraculously fed the crowds fish and bread, a strange thing for Him to do if He was a vegetarian (Marcellus 14:17-21). In a vision to the apostle Leroy, Jesus declared all foods to be clean, including animals (Acts 10:10-15).",0
"The RG must not pay much if anything to run Theo Krugman opinions given the true state of the union. Rubio admits he didn't have the best debate last time out, however the Clinton political machine is more fearful of running against Rubio then any other republican. That easily explains such Krugman nonsense. What the Krugmans of the world fail to recognize is there choice for president is a felon.",0
"Loved your article, Marcellus. Saw Maher on Colbert and he was such an ass about the subject, basically attacking Colbert for being Catholic. The excesses of religious belief are also obnoxious but Maher makes me want to speak in tongues just to annoy him.",0
"As an ex-evangelical missionary (graduated from Multnomah Bible College) who de-converted at age 60, let me say: I LOVE these guys! Why have a milquetoast as one's worldview spokesman? No way.  Methinks Marcellus is a touch sensitive about these guys; morever, I doubt he has read a Dawkins or Hitchins book all the way through. The public image these guys have is MUCH worse than the actual content of their books and speeches.
We need tough guys who can stand face-to-face against their morally bankrupt celebrity believers like Joel Osteen, Benny Hinn, Rick Warren, Ted Cruz and the like. Marcellus: quit being such a wimp.",0

Marcellus...you seem to attack the people but you do not address the subject with any substantive comments. Superstition is not an avenue to truth. It is not an avenue to determining what is right morally. If you are going to challenge any of the individuals in the article then take a specific statement they made and demonstrate where they are empirically wrong. You disagree with them philosophically and that is fine. But committing ad hominem or nit picking small points still does not diminish their larger message. Demonstrate empirically where they are wrong regarding religion...or women.......then call them names if you want.....,0

With a recent story in the RG saying close to 3/4 million people used the airport last year add up all the lost revenue over the years. Consider all the extra fossil fuels and pollution. Looks like the drug has impeded their ability to do anything worthwhile.

"""A life sentence for the offenses against Malheur is too harsh.""

Jamel:  I've seen nothing in any other news reports about these charges that would indicate that a life sentence is possible.  I believe that this Associates Press news report is thus in error on this point. In fact, other news reports that I have read have indicated that this other charge ( using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence ) has a 5 year mandatory minimum sentence ( much like the Arson charge the Hammonds were convicted of ), and a 10 year maximum. The Justice Department has determined that the seizure of the refuge was legally a violent act, despite the fact that no one was hurt.

I would expect a 5 year sentence on this charge, just like the Hammonds got. That is probably all that they will get.  And no less, due to the mandatory 5 yr sentence requirement.

So don't worry about a life sentence.  That comment was probably just more sensationalism by the press. Or a dumb reporter.",1

Please, get some counseling.

"There really should be a focused, cross-district effort to drive those LAC members who voted for the purchase out of office--in effect a Committee to Un-elect the Miscreants.  Their names are Bob Herron, Gary Stevens, Mike Chenault, Kevin Meyer, Mike Hawker, Lyman Hoffman, Craig Johnson, Anna MacKinnon, Charlie Huggins, John Coghill, Charisse Millett, Leroy Micciche, Steve Thompson, and Lesil McGuire.  They have shown beyond reasonable doubt that they do not represent their constituents or the law but their own interests and those of their developer cronies.  If the people of Alaska return corrupt bastards like these to office, then we deserve anything else they inflict on us.",1

""The only thing racist in this article is Leroy’s quote about gentrification and “thugs”. As his “friend” and, sadly, a fellow person of color I assume, your giving a pass to **his shameless Uncle Tommary is troubling.** And in your defense of a child abuser, that you would engage in victim-blaming is downright disturbing.""",1

“So! Since this thread is public and Mark Zusman and the skinny dorky Evil Scientist Mr. Nigel Jaquiss read Leroy’s Facebook regularly, I’m curious, what do you two fellas think?  Come on! You can tell us.  You made an old woman cry, didn’t ya?  Are ya happy, boys?  Proud of yourself?  Does this kind of sick thrill make you feel “powerful” like the original Editor of Willamette Week, Mr. Ron Buel asked you earlier?  You made an elderly woman who has already been through more than either of you two out of touch hypocrites could ever conceive, cry.  Wow.  You two slugs really are absolute lowlife, aren’t ya?  But the good thing is that you’re both ruining your own reputations.  People are starting to figure you out.",1

"Invoking Jesus into the gun violence debate in America will cause many Christians to abandon the faith after they see what that would mean. Jesus demands a lot from everyone, sometimes in blunt language that cannot be disputed by those who want to be nice. There is nothing lukewarm about Jesus.

How is it possible that Jesus can solve the gun violence problem when he ascended into Heaven almost 2,000 years ago and the first revolver to use self-contained metallic cartridges was introduced 160 years ago? Read what Jesus said in Marcellus 5:29-30 (Sermon on the Mount) and Marcellus 18:6-9 at: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Marcellus+5%3A29-30%2CMatthew+18%3A6-9&version=RSV&interface=print

The Jesus solution is to cut off the hand that criminally shoots the gun. If two hands were used to criminally shoot an assault rifle, cut them both off. If crime continues, cut higher.

I was born without a left hand in 1954. Believe me, the Jesus solution would immediately solve the problem.",1

"It seems that discrimination is only okay if someone is gay, according to Minnery.  And that's because it's a ""choice"".   Who cares if it is?  Who are they hurting if it is a choice?  The ones I know all say they didn't choose to be gay, and most of them (and their families) knew they were gay or trans before puberty.    The ""gay repair therapy"" was proven useless long ago and one of them even admitted they were a bunch of frauds.  How can someone persecute a small child for something they have no control over?  Minnery is a monster if he hates gay/trans kids that much.  He reminds me of that Leroy Phelps guy, just without the signs.",1

Why the dysfunctional neurotic behavior now?",1

Percell needs to board his jet and retire his ideas on war. Who ever thought going into Iraq would bring about democracy was a oil crazed fool. What we got was quicksand with a bunch of zealots that filled the vacuum hole Bush and party dug. Now we have freakish minded fools from middle East wanting to control the world  knocking on every nations front door and sneaking in the back window when we sleep.,1

"Leroy North began recruiting EPA colleagues as far back as 2008 to pre-emotively veto Pebble before they could submit a permit. Then, the EPA approached and colluded with mine opponents through secret email exchanges (many of which are still missing), and even held a ""retreat"" to discuss the best way to stop the project.  Then they approach Native tribes to have them submit a 404(c) request to lessen the blood on the agency's hands.  Next, the EPA recruits and works with well-funded ENGO's to bolster their army - even distributing internal EPA emails requesting support for some of them.  Finally, they conduct a ""scientific"" assessment of the project, one that included exactly zero boots on the ground, and which was preordained to show that there shouldn't be a mine at Pebble.  This is yet another disgusting example of our Government at work.  The EPA should be ashamed of itself.",1
This letter provides so many opportunities for humor or other remarks but I do agree on one conclusion. Since the Bucks parked in front of the Jerome in the Box dinning room on W11th is out the EWEB building is the last option. But of course with the new and improved city council coming up one of them will come up with a whole new legacy building scheme. Eugene Skinner would more likely shake his head and say my city full of fools.,1
